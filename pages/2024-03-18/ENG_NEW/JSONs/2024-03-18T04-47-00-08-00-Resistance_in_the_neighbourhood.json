Heraklion, where \n fascist groups are active trying to make the presence \n  them felt. Has an incident of an attack on a minor with a knife \n  In N. Heraklion Square last May, after an anti -fascist course \n  In N. Heraklion. Corresponding case with a knife attack occurred and \n After another anti -fascist mobilization in Kallithea last year \n February. Also, let's not forget the murderous attack on Shiraz Safetar \n to Perissos in August 2023, which is probably \n He was convened not to seem that he had racist motives.</div><div><br/></div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-18T04-47-00-08-00/000002.png\" width=\"400\"/></div><br/></div><div>It's all natural results, \n When on the lips of the official political scene and its policies \n 'Serious right' are heard statements that close the eye to fascism \n and suggest young people to seek enemies who 'alter the \n culture and values of the nation 'and responsible for the \n poverty and poverty of the popular strata but taha \n They are officially condemning fascism. When on social media \n Provided patterns of masculinity, cruelty, misogyny, racism \n  And in general hate to anything different.</div><div><br/></div><div>The \n  Young people carry anger towards the system. As long as the popular struggle and \n  The movement does not give real answers to the younger generation towards \n attack of the system, children and young people will become more prone \n to such behaviors and ideologies because of their need to belong \n  somewhere. With the logic of 'we against them', they are attracted by the \n Fascism that offers them exactly all this on the plate.</div><div><br/></div><div>THE \n  fascism in the form of the far -right is not accidental that it appears \n More and more worldwide, and especially in our country. It's the \n long hand of capital and bourgeois class, presented as \n anti -systemic force in order to hit the struggling people and the \n minorities and suppress them in the name of the system in which \n assumed to oppose. Fascism is the extension of \n capitalist system when it is forced.</div><div><br/></div><div>Is \n  important to create strong race networks based on resistance \n In the policy of the system that nourishes fascism but also \n Solidarity and unity, opposed to fascism and \n racist ideas. For this reason, youth and parents must \n politicize, recognize and fight fascism, to \n confront and respond to such behaviors and ideologies \n In any space, educational or not.<br/><div><div><br/></div><div>FASSIS TAKE FACE PARAINES</div><div></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">RESISTANCE IN NORTH</span></b></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://antistasistavoreia.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://antistasistavoreia.blogspot.com/</a><br/></div></div></div></div><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div>", "description": "", "author": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2!"], "labels": ["(\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9)\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2", "\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u0392\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1", "\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_77.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
