The demonstration was used by the participants to carry out various actions from within the demonstration and to set off pyrotechnics. As part of the demonstration, we distributed leaflets from the Red Women\u2019s Committees for March 8 and raised combative proletarian-feminist slogans against the double oppression of women through imperialism and patriarchy with a megaphone together with surrounding demonstrators. Many of the participants expressed their agreement that support for the struggle of the people of Palestine as a struggle against imperialism must be waged together with the struggle against patriarchy and were excited about the demonstration invitations to the Palestine demonstration in Bochum on March 22 at 6 pm at the Schauspielhaus in Bochum.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9797\" data-id=\"9797\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"768\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-12T06-55-00-08-00/000001.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-12T06-55-00-08-00/000001.png\" width=\"1024\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9798\" data-id=\"9798\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"768\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-12T06-55-00-08-00/000002.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-12T06-55-00-08-00/000002.png\" width=\"1024\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9799\" data-id=\"9799\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"768\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-12T06-55-00-08-00/000003.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-12T06-55-00-08-00/000003.png\" width=\"1024\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9800\" data-id=\"9800\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"768\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-12T06-55-00-08-00/000004.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-12T06-55-00-08-00/000004.png\" width=\"1024\"/></figure></figure><p>In Essen, we participated at 5 pm at Friedensplatz in the city center in a rally and short demonstration, an internationalist demonstration on March 8, in which we carried this year\u2019s banner of the Red League NRW with the slogan \u201cWomen Combat and Resist!
