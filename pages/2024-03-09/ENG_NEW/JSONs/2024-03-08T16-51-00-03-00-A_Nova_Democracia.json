Before him, two versions were written, with contributions from all ministries. The first was delivered on December 23, 2023, another on January 24, 2024.</p><p>Estad\u00e3o Press Monopoly journalist Francisco Leali accessed the different versions using the Access to Information Act and released excerpts in his March 8 column. Already the full final text, entitled \u201cMessage to the National Congress of 2024\u201d,<a href=\"https://www.gov.br/casacivil/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2024/janeiro/mensagem-presidencial-ao-congresso-nacional-2024/mensagem-ao-congresso-nacional-2024_vf.pdf/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">It is available on the internet</a>.</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Economic makeup</h4><p>In the economy, Lula's team struggled to deliberately camouflage or suppress the excerpts that indicated a worsening in the economic scenario in 2024.</p><p>In the first text, the Ministry of Finance made references expressed to the \u201cslowdown in growth to 2.2%\u201d. In clearest words: falling the economy by 2.2%. The \u201cfall in families consumption\u201d was also included among the difficulties of the year.</p><p>Already in the January version, both parties were excluded. In this second text, Haddad's team, now in a more inaccurate tone, addressed the difficulties that the country would pass from the scenario of international crisis, expressed in the \u201cturmoil in global financial markets\u201d and the \u201cuncertainties\u201d of the Chinese economy.</p><p>The version was again changed as delivered to Parliament. In the final text, in addition to the suppression of the fall of GDP, the Chinese crisis also disappeared. In its place, they entered the government's self-phase, which insisted on \u201cGDP growth\u201d in 2023 and the drop in prices. Malandly, the government avoided saying that GDP was mostly pulled by agribusiness - therefore, without reflexes in improving the quality of life of the people - and avoided prices that increased brutally by 2023 and will continue to grow by 2024, such as energy electric.</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The requirements of the commanders</h4><p>According to Francisco Leali, the Brazilian reactionary military began writing their text even before the formal request of the Civil House. M\u00facio, besides having triggered all sectors of the Ministry of Defense to write the document, also passed the pen to the commanders of the three forces.</p><p>Rook, the commanders did not spare at the time of requirements. When the Civil House made the formal request, he requested that he had \"about five pages.\" M\u00facio delivered nine. The government, submissive to the reactionary military since assuming, has maintained most of the document<strong>in full</strong>. Among the requirements of the millicada are \u201cstrategic projects\u201d for both the army and the aeronautics.</p><p>In addition to asking, the commanders also took advantage of creative freedom to<a href=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/governo-bajula-forcas-armadas-e-celebra-ineficacia-geral-em-reuniao-com-comandantes/\">hide their own failures of 2023</a>. Among the \u201cmilitary operations of support for the Brazilian population\u201d highlighted by them is Operation Yanomami, \u201cwith the following actions: i) air transportation of food baskets; and ii) aeromedical evacuation of indigenous people \u201d.</p><p>Neither the government nor the commanders nor M\u00facio remembered to mention in the report that until June last year, 50% of the baskets had not been delivered. They also avoided mentioning that the year closed with an increase in Yanomami deaths, perhaps precisely for the inoperability of the military, on the one hand, and the government, on the other.</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">According to the center: mentioned, but withdrawn</h4><p>Another passage altered by the government concerns the \"centron\". Lealli revealed that, in the first version of December of the text, the government stressed that it sought \u201cexcellence in the formation of the Ministries teams\u201d and that \u201cthe initiative also seeks to expand the dialogue between political agents and government agencies\u201d.</p><p>Here, the wit has rendered again: \u201cExcellence in the teams of Ministries\u201d is raised, but nothing says about the insertion of Andr\u00e9 Fufuca (PP-MA) in the Ministry of Sports only because it was the requirement of the centron for the approval of the framework Supervisor. Or the appointment, for the same reasons, by Silvio Costa Filho, a training educator and career politician, in the port and airport ministry portfolio, created only for the \u201ctake it-in-life\u201d. Is this the \u201cinterlocution between political agents and government agencies\u201d?</p><p>Both parties were suppressed in the official version, which does not mean that the practice of exchanging positions for favors will end. It just is not convenient to make explicit mention to her.</p></div>", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/governo-e-militares-querem-enganar-o-povo-na-mensagem-ao-congresso-nacional-de-2024/", "type": "article", "title": "Government and the military want to deceive the people in the 'message to the National Congress of 2024' - the new democracy", "description": "In text sent to Congress, Lula Make up the economy and hidden positions.
