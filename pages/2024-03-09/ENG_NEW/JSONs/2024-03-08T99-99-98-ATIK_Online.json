During the march that started at Kleber Square at 17.00, slogans were shouted for current political developments and women's struggle. In particular, slogans against the genocide attacks of the Zionist Israeli state against Palestine drew attention. At the end of the march, the Patriarchy system protested against women, while the violence against women was pointed out in France. After the speeches in front of the Strasbourg Courthouse, the action was terminated with slogans. In addition, during the march, the French statement issued by the New Woman was distributed.</p><style type=\"text/css\">#gallery-1 {\n                margin: auto;\n            }\n            #gallery-1 .gallery-item {\n                float: left;\n                margin-top: 10px;\n                text-align: center;\n                width: 33%;           }\n            #gallery-1 img {\n                border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n            }\n            #gallery-1 .gallery-caption {\n                margin-left: 0;\n            }</style><!-- see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php --><div class=\"gallery galleryid-85897\" id=\"gallery-1\"><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"56\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-08T99-99-98/000001.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-08T99-99-98/000001.jpg\" width=\"100\"/></dt></dl><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"56\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-08T99-99-98/000002.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-08T99-99-98/000002.jpg\" width=\"100\"/></dt></dl><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"56\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-08T99-99-98/000003.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-08T99-99-98/000003.jpg\" width=\"100\"/></dt></dl><br style=\"clear: both\"/><br style=\"clear: both;\"/></div><p></p></div>", "source": "https://www.atik-online.net/blog/strasbourgda-8-mart-yuruyusu", "type": "article", "title": "March 8 March in Strasbourg", "description": "Strasbourg", "author": ["muhabirmehmet"], "categories": ["Avrupa", "Haberler", "Manset"], "link-section": "haberler"}
