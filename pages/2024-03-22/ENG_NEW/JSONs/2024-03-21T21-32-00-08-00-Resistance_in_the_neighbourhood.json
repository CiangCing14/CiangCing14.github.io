Hotzoglou today (Thursday 21/3).</p><p>Although we do not know the exact reason it is called, it is clear that it is about its trade union and political action. After all, there are multiple trade unions and political persecutions (whether disciplinary, criminal or both) that are being carried out both in Piraeus and nationwide. After all, a few days before our competitor G. Kavvadias had been invited to \"written explanations\" by the Disciplinary Department of Piraeus, for an article he had posted on the internet!</p><p>It clips with the climate of terrorism attempted to impose. With the terrorist 49 arrests of students at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. With the loud judicial decisions on strike abstaining from individual evaluation. In the circular sent by the NPEC where he points out that the assessment of the assessment operation is part of the penalties of the new Criminal Code (about the \"shouts when people are entering a school unit\").</p><p>It will not pass all this climate. The people will break it in the streets with their struggles.</p><p>Today's witness test is doubly provocative as the day of the mobilization of associations, bodies, and colleges against trade union and political persecution has been sent.</p><p>The best answer they can get is to be a truly massive and dynamic demonstration that will shout all the persecutions.</p><p><b><u>ALL today at 18:30 at the rally and demonstration at the Piraeus Municipal Theater</u></b></p><p>DOWN THE DIVISIONS! TO STOP NOW, BUT EVERYONE EFFECTIVE NEWS NEWS</p><p>DOWN THE HANDS FROM THE FIGHTS, ASSOCIATIONS AND THE ADMINISTRATION-POLITICAL ACTION</p><p><u><i>We call on the Board of Directors of ELME Piraeus to gather on the day that H.
