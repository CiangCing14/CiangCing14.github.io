The Brahmanic patriarchy is a peculiar Indian room of the \n horrors. In a semi-colonial and semi-infeudal society, where women are \n  forced to live in this horror room</b>So what is the value of the constitution and fundamental rights?<b>The \n  women face multitudes of economic exploitation and \n non -economic that remains unpunished and male domination does from \n barrier to the general vision of society.</b>That it is \n regions torn by the war of western Asia, Palestine or \n of Ukraine or, whether it is Dhaka clothing factories, \n  of the Manipur Valley or the forestry belts of the Center \n of India, women around the world are facing the fire \n of imperialist crises. In India, the condition of the woman is not \n Sublime as propagated by the fascist of Bjp Narendra Modi. The \n Fascism Brahmanico Hindutva with the support of imperialism gives \n Sleeping and strength to one of the most inhuman forms of hierarchy system \n social that transforms women into an object of 'pleasure' e \n exploitation.</span></div><div><span></span><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-family: times;\">The \n  financial capital for its enhancement requires a market \n unified, source of low cost workforce and abundant resources \n natural. The oppression of women in the era of dying capitalism is \n  interconnected with the autocracy of financial capital. Incapable of \n Seeing these ropes that bind: it is like punishing in the dark. There is not \n doubt that the capitalism of the free-cambio, of the period \n manufacturing, has brought a significant number of darkened women \n  secret of the household chores to the factories. Because of this \n unprecedented expansion of social production, the movements of \n women of the working class entered the scene and gave birth to the \n subjectivity of women's rights movements.<b>Capitalism, \n wherever he has established himself, he has eliminated some patriarchal values \n feudal, but capitalism has created a new form of values \n patriarchals who devalue women's work.</b>Democracy \n bourgeois that is based on evident social and economic inequalities \n has not managed to put equality between women (half of the breed \n human) and<span></span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a><span style=\"font-family: times;\">men. Borghese Republic only in words promises \n equality to women, but actually supports the patriarchal system \n Oppressive that looks at the bottom of women. The society \n capitalist transforms every object into goods and women do not do \n exception and in reality in many forms. The deceptive bourgeois phrases \n they console women only in their imagination but in reality those \n phrases deny the existence of individuality to the women who brings \n to the absence of democratic rights. In the Manuvadi system [privileges for \n High caste] The woman is not considered as a free being. From the \n birth to death must be under the domain of the male.
