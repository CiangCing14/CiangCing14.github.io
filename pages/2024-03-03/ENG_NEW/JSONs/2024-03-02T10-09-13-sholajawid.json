Anis newspaper under the Taliban administration, in <br> In ': Cancer wrote 11, Saturday, 24739 Number editorial, <br> Sometimes the gathering and traditional meetings, the present <br> The problem was Afghanistan and governments in this way <br> They have gained their national and international legitimacy. <br> Although the Afghan Emirate of Afghanistan by the Council of Resolution and <br> Marriage <br> Is, but the world and the world do not leave it and <br> Demanding elections and councils and major traditional meetings <br>  \".stand <br> The editorial author confesses that holding a gathering <br> Taliban in Kabul under pressure from the critical situation of the Taliban regime and <br> The abnormal situation in Afghanistan and the pressure of the international community <br> Became the need to hold such a species, otherwise this group <br> Gathering and gaining national and international legitimacy of this <br> Has no way because the Taliban have their religious and national legitimacy <br> They have been obtained by the Council of Resolution. To <br> The author of the editorial like the world to that event <br> They don't let it go, he had to hold such a meeting. <br> Despite the fact that the Taliban constantly their goals and desires <br> Express vaguely, but the eleven -article resolution of the Malas Summit, many of the goals, priorities, and <br> The dangers that threaten this group made clarify. <br> Internal hypocrisy, social dissatisfaction and expansion of war <br> Armed against this group, especially the danger of ISIS of <br> The most important dangers are the Taliban face. <br> The Taliban in their own way, special and special people <br> Invite their confidence from the Wells. <br>  Article 13 and set their goals and desires in <br>  Dictated that eventually with a small 20 committees <br>  The Article was approved. Therefore <br> Elderly training, accuracy and agriculture, the status of the \"ninth, <br> Minorities and women and all nation and comprehensive progress and growth <br>  In \u00bbEconomic and Balanced Development in Shari'a Lighting <br> There was no initial Taliban plan. Situated <br> Taliban scholars eliminating the opening demand of schools <br> Girls from the ninth substance, the rest preserves it. <br> However, the main purpose of the Taliban at the meeting is to take allegiance <br> Was for the Emir of this group, but Brazelouh, in this <br> Meeting, from regional and world countries and the United Nations <br> Asked to make the Taliban as a legitimate system <br> Afghanistan to recognize and interact with this group <br> Positive and lift sanctions from Afghanistan and capital <br> Release Afghanistan. This Article of the Resolution <br> In contrast to the Taliban leader's remarks at the meeting <br> It was. <br> Now the question is that the inconsistent behavior and subject matter <br> Where does the Taliban and dumb dumb come from? Why the Taliban <br> They fear clear and explicit position. The reality of this <br> That is how the group's two -sided and vague speech is treated with <br> Their ideology and their objective state are related. Private life <br> Taliban as a retrograde and extremist group in the century <br> Twenty -one contradictory and challenging. Taliban from <br> One side of the country's crucial, ruined, rear <br> Residual, traditional and religious with the slogan of jihad against <br> Infidelity and invaders and adaptation of the Shari'ah <br> They do and do. But on the other hand, the group's victory without <br> Supporting countries and groups of regional and world possible <br> It wasn't. In other words, the Taliban could not be of the principles of political situation; Taliban <br> They want allegiance to people! The Taliban do not need the legitimacy of the people, it <br><br><br>  28 Number 10 Page <br>  Eternal flame <br> Their idiocy and beliefs to come and not be able to do without <br> Support and support some countries in the region and the world <br> Live up. That is why the Taliban leader one day <br> Rejects any relationship with America and the other day<br>It becomes strong with America. <br> However, the content of the Taliban's final resolution, however <br> Identified the Taliban's goals and priorities. Near Ring <br> To the Taliban leader to consolidate the position of Amir al -Momenin this <br> Is the group. This, in their opinion, is the most important condition of durability <br> And the survival of the Emirates and the prevention of weakening, breakdown and collapse <br> They are their perseverance. Rumi Hella Hella Akhundzadeh on the day <br> Our survival depends on unity \": The second meeting in Kabul said <br> . The Taliban's leader's concern for their survival is serious. <br> Is. Taliban durability and survival <br> The unity of this group is the group and according to the structure and thought <br> Taliban and their multiplicity, Taliban unity <br> Will only maintain with the reconciliation of the authority and the position of the Emir <br> became. Rumi Halla Hella Hella, with two former Taliban leaders, Fred <br>  It's tall. \"Civilian education\", but with degree <br> The current Taliban leadership, which in the past is mainly in the judiciary <br> The training was engaged, did not have sufficient authority and in <br> It was isolated. Taliban's true power mainly <br> Their commanders; Such as Serajuddin Haqqani and Malayqub and <br> Military -Political figures such as Amir Khan Motaghi and Malbarrad <br> Belonged. Now that internal hypocrisy and external pressure and <br> Widespread social dissatisfaction with the survival and life of this group <br> They should be, the Emir of this group must be righteous and authority <br> More to prevent a group of group competition and prevent weakening and collapse. From <br> This is the hard -working, hard -working, close -up ring of the Emir <br> To try, to take the leader out of the corner of isolation and <br> Consolidate his position. Taliban leaders meeting in <br> Kandahar in early spring of this year and a meeting in Kabul in Kabul <br> This year's cancer, in order to consolidate the leadership power of this <br> It has been a group. <br>  At a meeting within the Taliban in Kandahar, the Taliban leader <br> With the expectation and demand of other Taliban officials <br> Its explicit and decisive closure of the corporate schools <br> He raised. Although the opposition of some Taliban officials, to <br> The open and hidden face was raised against the plan, but the front <br> It failed to obtain the Taliban leader's orders. From the meeting <br> Taliban leaders in Kandahar on the sake of affairs in favor <br> The position of Rumi Hella Hella has progressed. She's for <br>  Out of Kandahar \"scholars across the country\" to take allegiance <br> It came and came to Kabul. It is as if the Taliban leader now all <br> Has taken the scientific Afghanistan and the national legitimacy and <br> His religious has increased. <br> Now the other question that arises is whether with <br> Taliban leader's authority will solve the problem of this group <br> Will their internal gaps and disagreements disappear? <br> The Taliban perhaps in Kuta with the stability of Amir al -Mu'minin <br> Prevent the risk of internal breakdowns and collapse, but in <br> Long -term. <br> The role will play. As well as the position so far too <br> Taliban leader extremism to global isolation and legitimacy <br><br><br>  28 Number 11 Page <br>  Eternal flame <br> The interior of this group has had a negative effect. according to <br>  World Country In March March 10 reports close to <br> Had to recognize the Taliban Emirate and from <br> Prevent more weakening the Taliban Emirate. But close <br> Girl's schools, on the orders of the Taliban leader, these countries from <br> Their decision gave up. In -country also after <br> The leader's restrictive and extreme commands and instructions <br> Taliban against citizens, and especially women <br> Armed and unarmed against the Taliban increased. Even <br> A number of Taliban moderate leaders against the sharp stance <br> Their leader protested. <br>  The month of their rule, inefficiency and 10 Taliban during the time <br> They showed their inability. This on the one hand the trust <br> Weakened to the Taliban's self and on the other side to <br> Taliban opposition forces have given more morale and courage. <br> Taliban cannot, social discontent and disagreement <br> End their internal and the global legitimacy to <br> brought. This group because of the structure and ideology of tight and <br> Their religious dry is unable to do so. <br> Another point that the Taliban confessed at this gathering <br> They were the existence and danger of ISIS. Taliban <br> Did not accept the existence of ISIS in the country and to war <br> They knew propaganda against them. Though the Taliban in this <br> ISIL's meeting as the danger and disruption of the country's security <br> They knew. But the reality is that strategically <br> And the time of what will lead to the destruction of the Taliban Emirate, <br> Struggles and rebellions and resistance of the people of the country and the masses <br> It will be the hard work of Afghanistan, not ISIS. <br> The situation in the country is now in such a way that and <br> The hatred of the Taliban is expanding. This <br> Potentially, the opportunity to grow revolutionary and popular tendencies in <br> It will be the country. The history of the past century Afghanistan to <br> Has proven and proved that the enemies of the people of every omnx <br> Who are not able to rule easily in this country <br> And last. That is why our party as a force <br> Vanguard, should workers, toilers, and all the people <br> The hard -working country with the azure and communist strategy and <br> Ready and lead a refreshment and in the way of overthrowing the regime <br> Taliban fundamentalism and the victory of the New Democratic Revolution and <br> Socialist.

Mawalna Invitation <br> Fazl Rahman to Kabul, part of the conflict to control tension <br> Is. Taliban leaders, including Amir of this group of Taliban <br> Pakistan has asked to reduce violence; That is yet to be content with the Pakistani army and government <br> Has not achieved. <br> Now the question is why the Taliban can't ask<br>Do the Pakistani government act? The fact <br> Emirates Taliban wants to be in a state of internal situation <br> It is critical and isolated by the world <br> Is, maintaining a balance between the Pakistani army and the Taliban <br> Slow. In the past ten years, the Pakistani government and <br> (TTP) helped the Taliban in Afghanistan <br> Is. In the current situation of the Taliban cannot be between the army <br> Pakistan and (TTP) choose one. If the Taliban to <br> The Pakistani army's request to listen to and to friends <br> Their ideological betrayal in Pakistan, the consequences <br> The political will bring them harmful. This <br> Now the Taliban Emirates by many groups <br> Extremously in the nationwide tendencies <br> Accused. Betrayal of Pakistani Taliban, this group's trust <br> And other Islamic groups will be deprived of the Taliban Emirate <br> Kurdish that made them away from the Taliban and to the side <br> ISIS will be inclined. Pakistani Taliban incitement in <br> Twenty years of war alongside the Afghan Taliban against <br> US and regime forces and in power <br> They took part twice. Now the Pakistani Taliban such <br> Expects in Pakistan to expect the Taliban Emirate to <br> Support. <br> On the other hand <br> The past, as if they were proud of war with foreign occupiers <br> Lifted out of the country, now with accusation of dependence and it <br> And servants are hardly sensitive to Pakistan. many of <br> Taliban leaders' harsh words <br> That this group wants to label the dependence on Pakistan <br> Clear their face. Most importantly. The Taliban <br>  Pakistan's 6000 force- claimed by the army of the country- over <br><br><br>  28 Number 19 Page <br>  Eternal flame <br> They have inside Afghanistan. Pure <br> Pakistan for the Taliban Emirate in Afghanistan <br> Is internal, so (TTP) now to the largest <br> The Taliban's problem has become. The Taliban Relationship of Afghanistan <br> And Pakistan is more different than the Taliban's relationship with other groups <br> Extremist area that with the Taliban over a period of twenty years <br> The past has been cooperating and is now working. <br> Pakistani Taliban apart from being in the past twenty years of <br> Afghan Taliban hosted, on the battlefield <br> Afghanistan against US military and allies and <br> The Kabul regime fought. Brazelouh, Mufti Noor Vali Mehud, <br> Pakistani Taliban Taliban leader, to Rumi Hella Holla Bayat <br> Has done and most importantly the Taliban on the two sides of the line <br> Durand mainly in ethnic, linguistic, geographical and cultural <br> They have many commonalities. <br> Tension's vision between the Taliban and the Pakistani army <br> In the past twenty years, the Taliban's simultaneous relationship with the army <br> Pakistan and (TP) were in favor of this group but now that <br> Taliban have taken over the power, the companions <br> Their ideological across the Durand line to their Achilles <br> Has become. Anyway now the possibility of decline <br> And the likelihood of tension between the Pakistani army and the Emirates <br> There are Taliban. <br> Ideological and extremist nature of the Taliban and the flexibility of <br> This group is the necessity of maintaining internal cohesion and getting rid of sense <br> The inferiority of the Pakistani dependence causes the Taliban <br> In contrast, the Pakistani army and government will not shorten. To <br> The same arrangement of expanding insecurity in Pakistan, army <br> It has forced the country to suppress (TTP) and <br> Cut the support behind his front. This is the main factor <br> Intensifying tension between the Pakistani army and the Emirates <br> It is the Taliban. But on the other hand because of a critical economy <br> Both sides and the unstable and bankrupt status of both <br> The country has made the opposition more uncomfortable. <br> Afghanistan's economy under the Taliban's bids thanks to organizations <br> Charity and UN US Charity and Imperialism, <br> Half -strap progresses. Closing the transit roads <br> It will be more harmful to the devastating economy of Afghanistan. <br> Pakistan's bankrupt economy is also due to the blocking of the way <br> Reconciliation will be harmed with Afghanistan and Central Asia <br> became. Therefore the Pakistani government with pressure tools that <br> So far has been used in Talesh. Taliban to <br> Observing. Today, with previous years, security <br> Pakistan is endangered from Afghan territory and the Emirates <br> The Taliban to intervene in Pakistani affairs through support <br> It is a Pakistani Taliban provincial. Pakistani government cannot <br> Easily support the Taliban opposition leaders because then the level of dissatisfaction in the Pashtunka and <br> Baluchistan will be more than the Pakistani government and <br> (TP) uses this dissatisfaction. <br> Finally <br> Intensify tension between the Pakistani government and the Islamic Emirate <br> The Taliban surprised many. Particularly those who <br> Believed the Taliban's victory, in fact, the victory of the state and <br> It is the Pakistani army. Now the question is whether the army <br> Pakistan did not imagine that in case of re -power <br> Taliban, Pakistani security will be more at risk <br> it fell? The fact is that the ruling classes and the state <br> Pakistan's reactionary with complicated contradictions and crises <br> It is facing. Therefore for a bankrupt government like <br> Pakistan is simply not possible <br> Solve and pull out of its critical situation. They to <br> Inevitably, by solving a problem, another problem for one's own <br> Create. <br> In the last twenty years, the US -based regime in <br> Kabul not only rejected the Durand Mazar Line but also relationships <br> Had close to the Indian government and the puppet regime officials, <br> Pakistan was accused of defending and refuge in the Taliban. <br> This contradiction was strengthened when American imperialism of <br>  To the next to inhibit power to 2010 and 2009 years <br> Spreading China and weakening the country to its regional rival <br> That is, India approached. In adhering to their regime's masters <br> Kabul also developed relations with India. Pakistan in action<br>Talefi, extended relations with China and for <br> Pressure on a puppet regime, restriction on the Taliban <br> Reduced. Taliban use this in their favor <br> They did. <br> Another point is that the Taliban is seeking dependency this time <br> Absolute, as in the first round of this group of this group to Pakistan <br> Had, to argue or at least reduce it. At <br> The first round of the Taliban Emirate, the group's foreign relations <br> It was Pakistan and almost all global aid to Afghanistan <br> Done through Pakistan. This time but countries <br> The region, including Iran, China, Russia and Asia <br> Middle- who in the past opposed the Taliban- Relations <br> Are directly political and economic with the Taliban and <br> The representatives of these countries are active in Kabul. Tale <br> Taliban to expand economic relations with these countries <br> Relieve from dependence on Pakistan's transit roads. <br>  In the overthrow of Pakistan's 2001 cooperation with the US in year <br> The first period of the Taliban Emirate, another factor of mistrust <br> The Taliban is compared to Pakistan. <br> Pakistan during the Cold War expanded its policy in citizenship of <br><br><br>  28 Number 20 Page <br>  Eternal flame <br> The interests of American imperialism in the region had coordinated. <br> After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan to the base <br> The administration and training of the Middle East Islamic Jihad and others <br> The Islamic countries had become. Pakistani schools with <br> US and Saudi Arabia's financial and economic support <br> Other were the mainstream of Islamic insights. <br> Supporting the Mojahedin and then the Taliban part of this <br> The US project was Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Should be mentioned <br> Pakistani Army and Information Organization (ISI). <br> Afghanistan from the Islamic forces in the Kashmir war against <br> The Indian government also used. <br> With the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet imperialism and the fall of <br> Extremist Eslam Empowerment In Iran and then Afghanistan, <br> Other Islamic fundamentalism with the interests of the US and its allies in <br> The contrast was placed. American imperialism almost for more than <br> A decade in the early twenty -one century, the fundamentalistism <br> Under the name of terrorism, he was attacked. Taliban overthrow and <br> Repression <br> It was a Islamic. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in two <br> Supported last decade of Islamic extremist groups <br> Were but now these groups, including al -Qaeda, ISIS and <br> (TTP) to threaten and threaten their own internal security <br> became; It is as if the wells they had been carried out in itself <br> They have fallen. <br>  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as two traditional supporters <br> Taliban now have the coldest relationship with them, but the middle <br> Pakistan as other Taliban sponsor now of friendship <br> Towards moving toward hostility. Security crisis in <br> Pakistan is serious, so the army and information organization <br> Pakistan.
