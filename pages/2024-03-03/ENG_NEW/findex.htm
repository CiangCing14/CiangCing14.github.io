There is no higher than the honor of belonging to this army. "</strong>(Stalin)</p><p>As the history books show, Comrade Lenin, the great leader of the working class and the oppressed people in the world, became the second major milestone of Marxism-Leninism-Leninism-Leninism-Leninism, on January 21, 1924, and left a great legacy of invaluable value. Comrade Lenin's doctrine, who transformed the "future world", whose basis was laid by Marx and angel, from an abstract opportunity to a concrete reality, is still fully relevant after a century and major upheavals in the world. In order to be able to position yourself properly in the class struggle, one must accept this "timeliness" and orient yourself to it. This "timeliness" is also a cure for reformist, revisionist and parliamentary cretinism, which means capitulation and compromise with ruling ideologies of all kinds. It is the guarantee of faith and determination for a communist world to be created.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lenin as the teacher of communism, who broke the ice and paved the way to the international reaction and revisionism</h4><p>To identify the contradictions in the history of the class struggle correctly, to understand the moments of historical fracture and to be prepared in these moments was the most outstanding feature of the entire comrade Lenin's struggle and to his immortality. After Marx 'and Engels' death, the leadership of the international proletariat was long taken over by the opportunism in the other international, and with comrade Stalin's words:<strong>“A period in which the parties in the other international were unable to take over the theoretical struggle to free the international proletariat and the world's oppressed people from the influence of these opportunistic and class complex Social Democrats. In addition to the theoretical struggle to release the international proletariat and the world's oppressed people, he developed with the founding of the communist international an organizational and fighting form that was adapted to the dynamics of the class struggle in the new period of capitalism. ”</strong></p><p>Comrade Lenin transformed the Communist Party and the communist international into a war instrument against the bourgeoisie by freeing the Communist Party and the movement of the communist international from the links of the legal battle forms:<strong>"Instead of a revolutionary policy, there was limp philistinism and dirty political negotiations, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary intrigues. For the sake of, of course, 'revolutionary' resolutions and passwords were adopted ... ”</strong>, but as it "stores in the drawers in its offices," freed from the grip of legal forms of combat.<strong>"Meanwhile, a new period of imperialist wars and the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat approached. The old combat methods proved to be obviously inadequate and impotent against the allestage of financial capital. It became necessary to revise the entire international activities, all its working method, and to expel all philistinism, narrow -mindedness, political scam, renegatism, social wine wineism and social pacifism. It was necessary to review the entire arsenal of the second international, to throw out everything that was rusty and obsolete and forged new weapons. Without this preparation, it was useless to go to war against capitalism. Without this work, the proletariat risked being insufficiently armed, or even completely unarmed, in future revolutionary struggles. The honor of conducting this general overhaul and the general cleansing of the other internationales</strong><strong>augiastall</strong><strong>accrue to Leninism. ”</strong>(Stalin, on the basis of Leninism).</p><p>Comrade Lenin, with his genius, understood the core of the contradiction and realized that the fight against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking off the burdens that rest on the back of the international proletariat, without fighting revisionism and opportunism, without showing the masses these The true nature of the perceptions in theory and practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By establishing the dialectical and necessary connection between the "inner match" and the "outer match", he led a double match.</p><p>Comrade Lenin left us communists The extremely important lessons that the fight against revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the fight against imperialism and all forms of ruling reaction. On the contrary, the fight against imperialism must be cleansed of revisionism and opportunism.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Keep Lenin's teaching high in the stricter contradictions of the imperialist system</h4><p>The imperialist system that Comrade Lenin analyzed in detail in the early 20th century has survived the last period, but the contradictions are tightened and it is in a spiral of insoluble antagonistic contradictions. Although the dissolution of the Soviet Union and China's integration process in the capitalist system prevented the contradictions from exploding for a while, the law on the uneven development of capitalism continued, and the interimperialist rivalry developed into the "dissolution phase" characterized by regional wars. This shows what crisis system is in and that the previous "solutions" no longer work. The imperialists, who long maintained their crisis by pushing the burdens of the system over the hemispheres and reinforced the looting of the hemispheres, have also come to a blind track here.</p><p>One of the explosive points of the inherent problems of the imperialist system, which has evolved in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism, is that the interimperialist struggle, which has manifested itself in various forms in recent years, is currently being fought in regional wars. When Lenin listed the contradictions of imperialism, he mentioned the interimperialist contradiction as one of the three most important.</p><p>We see that the development is in line with Comrade Lenin's views on the nature of imperialism and contradictions:<strong>"The other contradiction is the contradiction between the various financial groups and imperialist powers in their struggle for raw material sources, on foreign territory. Imperialism is capital exports to the sources of raw material, the insane battle for monopoly possession of these sources, the struggle for a new division of the already divided world, a struggle brought with special rage by new financial groups and powers seeking a "place in the sun" against the sun "against the old groups And the powers that stubbornly hold on to what they have conquered. This insane struggle between the various capitalist groups is remarkable because it as an inevitable element includes imperialist wars, wars for the annexation of foreign territories. This circumstance, in turn, is remarkable because it leads to a mutual weakening of the imperialists, to a weakening of the position of capitalism in general, to an acceleration of the arrival of the proletarian revolution and to the practical necessity of this revolution. "</strong>(Stalin, on the basis of Leninism).</p><p>Russia and China, the former socialist countries that, with their emerging new markets, have given the imperialist system a respite, has become the main actors of the interimperialist rivalry with the Hegemonaks of the United States. This means that the contradictions have increased in scope and character as new and powerful players have been involved in the battle for redistribution of territories. The great confrontation with the invasion of the Russian imperialism of Ukraine took place against this backdrop. It is predictable that this trend will be reinforced and spread further. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the imperialists, there are hemispheres and colonies that are subject to division war. The world's semi -colonies and oppressed people will continue to pay the prize for these wars until the imperialists declares direct war on each other.</p><p>With this will<em>The division of the world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed land</em>- Mastically analyzed by Lenin - be further immersed. The third contradiction is tightened with the imperialist looting and the looting, and the semi -colonial and semi -fluttered rebellion in powerful national liberation wars and folk wars that shake the imperialist system.</p><p>Parallel to the process that imperialism undergoes the interimperialist contradictions, and the contradiction between imperialist countries and oppressed people and nations, all parts of the ruling system - especially the imperialist states - become more centralized, militarist and wars. fascist currents to bring society into a similar ideological format. This is done either by so -called right -wing extremists or under the cover of social democratic or liberal parties. Communists and the oppressed people in the world, facing a system that becomes more reactionary and aggressive day by day, need a Leninist party to lead the proletariat's struggle for political power, as comrade Lenin outlined, to organize a strong opposition to this reaction . Only such a party, today a Marxist-Leninist-Maoistic party, can wipe an irreconcilable battle against the bourgeoisie.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lenin's great heritage, the Leninist perception of the party: the general staff of the proletariat</h4><p><strong>And Revolut</strong><strong>sj</strong><strong>on is not</strong><strong>and you</strong><strong>rural</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>or as</strong><strong>to</strong><strong>write an essay or paint a picture or</strong><strong>to</strong><strong>Broders; it can't be</strong><strong>so</strong><strong>refined,</strong><strong>so</strong><strong>sti</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>lf</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>rig and gentle,</strong><strong>or</strong><strong>so</strong><strong>must</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>E -team, friend</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>corpse, polite, restrained and sternsin</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>And. Revolved</strong><strong>sj</strong><strong>on is on</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>n Resurrection</strong><strong>, an act of violence where</strong><strong>j</strong><strong>than</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>m one class crashes an an</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>in.</strong>(Mao Zedong).</p><p>It is crucial how the communists define the existing contradictions and how they place themselves towards development. Throughout the hundred years since the death of Comrade Lenin, the imperialists have transformed their ruling structures into even larger war machines. Their armies, police, secret services, etc. are equipped with capacities that are unsavigatable with the past. On the other hand, a significant proportion of those who call themselves "communists" or "revolutionaries" ignore this reality (although it seems to be theoretically accepted), and is far from positioning itself in accordance with it. By following an ideological and practical line for reconciliation, which locks the working class and the undisturbed masses firmly to the ruling system, they instead dampen the anger of the masses and act as waves. While the imperialists and the ruling structures for exploitation end up with increasingly violent appliances and institutions, it is necessary, as followers of comrades Lenin, to lead a strong ideological struggle against the fact that those who define themselves as "revolutionary" and "communists »Moves further and further away from the reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on weapons and violence. One of the most important tasks for performing Comrade Lenin justice during the centenary of his immortality is to start with comrade Lenin's unstoppable struggle against opportunism in the second international.</p><p>Comrade Lenin defined the new type of communist party as the "proletariat's war organization". This definition was necessitated by the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October Revolution and the Civil War that broke out with the October Revolution were the specific reasons why Comrade Lenin called the Communist Party "The Proletariat's war organizion". It is a necessity that the Communist Party, which will lead the liberation of the proletariat and the oppressed, has the hallmark of the mass, while the counter -revolution arms itself from head to toe with violence and violence and commit all of these cruel massacres against the working class and the oppressed people. A revolutionary war needs a fighting party to lead it. Only fools and unrelated revisionists who rely on the bourgeoisie can see it differently.</p><p><strong>Some people make fun of us to be supporters of "the omnipotence of the war". Yes, we are supporters of the omnipotent of the revolutionary war; It's good, not bad, it's Marxist. The Russian Communist Party's rifles created socialism. We will create a democratic republic. Experience from the class struggle in the imperialist era teaches us that it is only through the power of the rifle that the working class and the working masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and the armed landlords; In this sense, we can say that it is only with rifles that the whole world can be reshaped.</strong>(Mao Zedong)</p><p>At its stifle conference, the IKF defined the structure and reconstitution of the Communist parties as an important task in the struggle for the proletarian world revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party that Comrade Mao Zedong developed is in line with the understanding of the Communist Party as Comrade Lenin sketched out, who was enriched by Stalin, and is in the Marxist-Leninist-Maoistic ideology the realization of the Leninist understanding of the party. During the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions that we are in, a communist party that is capable of standing against the increasing aggression of the imperialist reaction, and leading the proletariat and the world's oppressed people to liberation, must have the quality of a "proletariat's war organization".</p><p>An essential part of Lenin's heritage is the question of political power as the basic question for all revolutions. Lenin showed how<strong>"The proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois state machinery and without replacing this with a new one"</strong>, and how<strong>"Everything except power is an illusion"</strong>. Under Lenin's personal leadership, the world's first socialist state and the dictatorship of the proletariat were established, and cemented the proletarian path to power and to retain it.</p><p>After Lenin's death, it was his successor Stalin who brilliantly defined Leninism, developed it further and made it the entire basis of the international communist movement. On the shoulders of the Great Lenin, chairman Mao managed to advance the proletarian world revolution to greater heights and further developed the ideology of the proletariat. Leninism, which today is Maoism-Leninism-Maoism, must be embraced, defended and used today.</p><p>As IKF, we will continue to perform the tasks that the big Lenin put in front of us, and make good use of the legacy that Comrade Lenin has left to us.</p><p>Comrade Lenin, the International Proletariat and Marxism-Leninism-Maoism's great teacher, leader and guide our struggle for the proletarian world revolution, today, as he did yesterday!</p><p><strong>Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!</strong><br><br><strong>Live the proletarian internationalism!</strong></br></br></p><p class="has-text-align-right">International Communist Federation<br>January 2024</br></p></section>

To <br/> The author of the editorial like the world to that event <br/> They don't let it go, he had to hold such a meeting. <br/> Despite the fact that the Taliban constantly their goals and desires <br/> Express vaguely, but the eleven -article resolution of the Malas Summit, many of the goals, priorities, and <br/> The dangers that threaten this group made clarify. <br/> Internal hypocrisy, social dissatisfaction and expansion of war <br/> Armed against this group, especially the danger of ISIS of <br/> The most important dangers are the Taliban face. <br/> The Taliban in their own way, special and special people <br/> Invite their confidence from the Wells. <br/>  Article 13 and set their goals and desires in <br/>  Dictated that eventually with a small 20 committees <br/>  The Article was approved.

This Article of the Resolution <br/> In contrast to the Taliban leader's remarks at the meeting <br/> It was. <br/> Now the question is that the inconsistent behavior and subject matter <br/> Where does the Taliban and dumb dumb come from? Why the Taliban <br/> They fear clear and explicit position. The reality of this <br/> That is how the group's two -sided and vague speech is treated with <br/> Their ideology and their objective state are related. Private life <br/> Taliban as a retrograde and extremist group in the century <br/> Twenty -one contradictory and challenging.

But on the other hand, the group's victory without <br/> Supporting countries and groups of regional and world possible <br/> It wasn't. In other words, the Taliban could not be of the principles of political situation; Taliban <br/> They want allegiance to people! The Taliban do not need the legitimacy of the people, it <br/><br/><br/>  28 Number 10 Page <br/>  Eternal flame <br/> Their idiocy and beliefs to come and not be able to do without <br/> Support and support some countries in the region and the world <br/> Live up. That is why the Taliban leader one day <br/> Rejects any relationship with America and the other day<br/>It becomes strong with America. <br/> However, the content of the Taliban's final resolution, however <br/> Identified the Taliban's goals and priorities. Near Ring <br/> To the Taliban leader to consolidate the position of Amir al -Momenin this <br/> Is the group. This, in their opinion, is the most important condition of durability <br/> And the survival of the Emirates and the prevention of weakening, breakdown and collapse <br/> They are their perseverance. Rumi Hella Hella Akhundzadeh on the day <br/> Our survival depends on unity ": The second meeting in Kabul said <br/> . The Taliban's leader's concern for their survival is serious. <br/> Is. Taliban durability and survival <br/> The unity of this group is the group and according to the structure and thought <br/> Taliban and their multiplicity, Taliban unity <br/> Will only maintain with the reconciliation of the authority and the position of the Emir <br/> became. Rumi Halla Hella Hella, with two former Taliban leaders, Fred <br/>  It's tall. "Civilian education", but with degree <br/> The current Taliban leadership, which in the past is mainly in the judiciary <br/> The training was engaged, did not have sufficient authority and in <br/> It was isolated. Taliban's true power mainly <br/> Their commanders; Such as Serajuddin Haqqani and Malayqub and <br/> Military -Political figures such as Amir Khan Motaghi and Malbarrad <br/> Belonged. Now that internal hypocrisy and external pressure and <br/> Widespread social dissatisfaction with the survival and life of this group <br/> They should be, the Emir of this group must be righteous and authority <br/> More to prevent a group of group competition and prevent weakening and collapse. From <br/> This is the hard -working, hard -working, close -up ring of the Emir <br/> To try, to take the leader out of the corner of isolation and <br/> Consolidate his position. Taliban leaders meeting in <br/> Kandahar in early spring of this year and a meeting in Kabul in Kabul <br/> This year's cancer, in order to consolidate the leadership power of this <br/> It has been a group. <br/>  At a meeting within the Taliban in Kandahar, the Taliban leader <br/> With the expectation and demand of other Taliban officials <br/> Its explicit and decisive closure of the corporate schools <br/> He raised. Although the opposition of some Taliban officials, to <br/> The open and hidden face was raised against the plan, but the front <br/> It failed to obtain the Taliban leader's orders. From the meeting <br/> Taliban leaders in Kandahar on the sake of affairs in favor <br/> The position of Rumi Hella Hella has progressed. She's for <br/>  Out of Kandahar "scholars across the country" to take allegiance <br/> It came and came to Kabul. It is as if the Taliban leader now all <br/> Has taken the scientific Afghanistan and the national legitimacy and <br/> His religious has increased. <br/> Now the other question that arises is whether with <br/> Taliban leader's authority will solve the problem of this group <br/> Will their internal gaps and disagreements disappear? <br/> The Taliban perhaps in Kuta with the stability of Amir al -Mu'minin <br/> Prevent the risk of internal breakdowns and collapse, but in <br/> Long -term. <br/> The role will play. As well as the position so far too <br/> Taliban leader extremism to global isolation and legitimacy <br/><br/><br/>  28 Number 11 Page <br/>  Eternal flame <br/> The interior of this group has had a negative effect. according to <br/>  World Country In March March 10 reports close to <br/> Had to recognize the Taliban Emirate and from <br/> Prevent more weakening the Taliban Emirate.

Even <br/> A number of Taliban moderate leaders against the sharp stance <br/> Their leader protested. <br/>  The month of their rule, inefficiency and 10 Taliban during the time <br/> They showed their inability. This on the one hand the trust <br/> Weakened to the Taliban's self and on the other side to <br/> Taliban opposition forces have given more morale and courage. <br/> Taliban cannot, social discontent and disagreement <br/> End their internal and the global legitimacy to <br/> brought. This group because of the structure and ideology of tight and <br/> Their religious dry is unable to do so. <br/> Another point that the Taliban confessed at this gathering <br/> They were the existence and danger of ISIS. Taliban <br/> Did not accept the existence of ISIS in the country and to war <br/> They knew propaganda against them. Though the Taliban in this <br/> ISIL's meeting as the danger and disruption of the country's security <br/> They knew. But the reality is that strategically <br/> And the time of what will lead to the destruction of the Taliban Emirate, <br/> Struggles and rebellions and resistance of the people of the country and the masses <br/> It will be the hard work of Afghanistan, not ISIS. <br/> The situation in the country is now in such a way that and <br/> The hatred of the Taliban is expanding. This <br/> Potentially, the opportunity to grow revolutionary and popular tendencies in <br/> It will be the country. The history of the past century Afghanistan to <br/> Has proven and proved that the enemies of the people of every omnx <br/> Who are not able to rule easily in this country <br/> And last.

Mawalna Invitation <br/> Fazl Rahman to Kabul, part of the conflict to control tension <br/> Is. Taliban leaders, including Amir of this group of Taliban <br/> Pakistan has asked to reduce violence; That is yet to be content with the Pakistani army and government <br/> Has not achieved. <br/> Now the question is why the Taliban can't ask<br/>Do the Pakistani government act? The fact <br/> Emirates Taliban wants to be in a state of internal situation <br/> It is critical and isolated by the world <br/> Is, maintaining a balance between the Pakistani army and the Taliban <br/> Slow. In the past ten years, the Pakistani government and <br/> (TTP) helped the Taliban in Afghanistan <br/> Is. In the current situation of the Taliban cannot be between the army <br/> Pakistan and (TTP) choose one. If the Taliban to <br/> The Pakistani army's request to listen to and to friends <br/> Their ideological betrayal in Pakistan, the consequences <br/> The political will bring them harmful. This <br/> Now the Taliban Emirates by many groups <br/> Extremously in the nationwide tendencies <br/> Accused. Betrayal of Pakistani Taliban, this group's trust <br/> And other Islamic groups will be deprived of the Taliban Emirate <br/> Kurdish that made them away from the Taliban and to the side <br/> ISIS will be inclined. Pakistani Taliban incitement in <br/> Twenty years of war alongside the Afghan Taliban against <br/> US and regime forces and in power <br/> They took part twice. Now the Pakistani Taliban such <br/> Expects in Pakistan to expect the Taliban Emirate to <br/> Support. <br/> On the other hand <br/> The past, as if they were proud of war with foreign occupiers <br/> Lifted out of the country, now with accusation of dependence and it <br/> And servants are hardly sensitive to Pakistan. many of <br/> Taliban leaders' harsh words <br/> That this group wants to label the dependence on Pakistan <br/> Clear their face. Most importantly. The Taliban <br/>  Pakistan's 6000 force- claimed by the army of the country- over <br/><br/><br/>  28 Number 19 Page <br/>  Eternal flame <br/> They have inside Afghanistan. Pure <br/> Pakistan for the Taliban Emirate in Afghanistan <br/> Is internal, so (TTP) now to the largest <br/> The Taliban's problem has become. The Taliban Relationship of Afghanistan <br/> And Pakistan is more different than the Taliban's relationship with other groups <br/> Extremist area that with the Taliban over a period of twenty years <br/> The past has been cooperating and is now working. <br/> Pakistani Taliban apart from being in the past twenty years of <br/> Afghan Taliban hosted, on the battlefield <br/> Afghanistan against US military and allies and <br/> The Kabul regime fought. Brazelouh, Mufti Noor Vali Mehud, <br/> Pakistani Taliban Taliban leader, to Rumi Hella Holla Bayat <br/> Has done and most importantly the Taliban on the two sides of the line <br/> Durand mainly in ethnic, linguistic, geographical and cultural <br/> They have many commonalities. <br/> Tension's vision between the Taliban and the Pakistani army <br/> In the past twenty years, the Taliban's simultaneous relationship with the army <br/> Pakistan and (TP) were in favor of this group but now that <br/> Taliban have taken over the power, the companions <br/> Their ideological across the Durand line to their Achilles <br/> Has become. Anyway now the possibility of decline <br/> And the likelihood of tension between the Pakistani army and the Emirates <br/> There are Taliban. <br/> Ideological and extremist nature of the Taliban and the flexibility of <br/> This group is the necessity of maintaining internal cohesion and getting rid of sense <br/> The inferiority of the Pakistani dependence causes the Taliban <br/> In contrast, the Pakistani army and government will not shorten. To <br/> The same arrangement of expanding insecurity in Pakistan, army <br/> It has forced the country to suppress (TTP) and <br/> Cut the support behind his front. This is the main factor <br/> Intensifying tension between the Pakistani army and the Emirates <br/> It is the Taliban. But on the other hand because of a critical economy <br/> Both sides and the unstable and bankrupt status of both <br/> The country has made the opposition more uncomfortable. <br/> Afghanistan's economy under the Taliban's bids thanks to organizations <br/> Charity and UN US Charity and Imperialism, <br/> Half -strap progresses. Closing the transit roads <br/> It will be more harmful to the devastating economy of Afghanistan. <br/> Pakistan's bankrupt economy is also due to the blocking of the way <br/> Reconciliation will be harmed with Afghanistan and Central Asia <br/> became. Therefore the Pakistani government with pressure tools that <br/> So far has been used in Talesh. Taliban to <br/> Observing. Today, with previous years, security <br/> Pakistan is endangered from Afghan territory and the Emirates <br/> The Taliban to intervene in Pakistani affairs through support <br/> It is a Pakistani Taliban provincial. Pakistani government cannot <br/> Easily support the Taliban opposition leaders because then the level of dissatisfaction in the Pashtunka and <br/> Baluchistan will be more than the Pakistani government and <br/> (TP) uses this dissatisfaction. <br/> Finally <br/> Intensify tension between the Pakistani government and the Islamic Emirate <br/> The Taliban surprised many. Particularly those who <br/> Believed the Taliban's victory, in fact, the victory of the state and <br/> It is the Pakistani army. Now the question is whether the army <br/> Pakistan did not imagine that in case of re -power <br/> Taliban, Pakistani security will be more at risk <br/> it fell? The fact is that the ruling classes and the state <br/> Pakistan's reactionary with complicated contradictions and crises <br/> It is facing. Therefore for a bankrupt government like <br/> Pakistan is simply not possible <br/> Solve and pull out of its critical situation. They to <br/> Inevitably, by solving a problem, another problem for one's own <br/> Create. <br/> In the last twenty years, the US -based regime in <br/> Kabul not only rejected the Durand Mazar Line but also relationships <br/> Had close to the Indian government and the puppet regime officials, <br/> Pakistan was accused of defending and refuge in the Taliban. <br/> This contradiction was strengthened when American imperialism of <br/>  To the next to inhibit power to 2010 and 2009 years <br/> Spreading China and weakening the country to its regional rival <br/> That is, India approached. In adhering to their regime's masters <br/> Kabul also developed relations with India. Pakistan in action<br/>Talefi, extended relations with China and for <br/> Pressure on a puppet regime, restriction on the Taliban <br/> Reduced. Taliban use this in their favor <br/> They did. <br/> Another point is that the Taliban is seeking dependency this time <br/> Absolute, as in the first round of this group of this group to Pakistan <br/> Had, to argue or at least reduce it. At <br/> The first round of the Taliban Emirate, the group's foreign relations <br/> It was Pakistan and almost all global aid to Afghanistan <br/> Done through Pakistan. This time but countries <br/> The region, including Iran, China, Russia and Asia <br/> Middle- who in the past opposed the Taliban- Relations <br/> Are directly political and economic with the Taliban and <br/> The representatives of these countries are active in Kabul. Tale <br/> Taliban to expand economic relations with these countries <br/> Relieve from dependence on Pakistan's transit roads. <br/>  In the overthrow of Pakistan's 2001 cooperation with the US in year <br/> The first period of the Taliban Emirate, another factor of mistrust <br/> The Taliban is compared to Pakistan. <br/> Pakistan during the Cold War expanded its policy in citizenship of <br/><br/><br/>  28 Number 20 Page <br/>  Eternal flame <br/> The interests of American imperialism in the region had coordinated. <br/> After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan to the base <br/> The administration and training of the Middle East Islamic Jihad and others <br/> The Islamic countries had become. Pakistani schools with <br/> US and Saudi Arabia's financial and economic support <br/> Other were the mainstream of Islamic insights. <br/> Supporting the Mojahedin and then the Taliban part of this <br/> The US project was Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Should be mentioned <br/> Pakistani Army and Information Organization (ISI). <br/> Afghanistan from the Islamic forces in the Kashmir war against <br/> The Indian government also used. <br/> With the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet imperialism and the fall of <br/> Extremist Eslam Empowerment In Iran and then Afghanistan, <br/> Other Islamic fundamentalism with the interests of the US and its allies in <br/> The contrast was placed. American imperialism almost for more than <br/> A decade in the early twenty -one century, the fundamentalistism <br/> Under the name of terrorism, he was attacked. Taliban overthrow and <br/> Repression <br/> It was a Islamic. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in two <br/> Supported last decade of Islamic extremist groups <br/> Were but now these groups, including al -Qaeda, ISIS and <br/> (TTP) to threaten and threaten their own internal security <br/> became; It is as if the wells they had been carried out in itself <br/> They have fallen. <br/>  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as two traditional supporters <br/> Taliban now have the coldest relationship with them, but the middle <br/> Pakistan as other Taliban sponsor now of friendship <br/> Towards moving toward hostility. Security crisis in <br/> Pakistan is serious, so the army and information organization <br/> Pakistan.

Among these were Palestinian-minded and revolutionary protesters.<span id="more-4948"></span></p><div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4950" style="width: 248px"><img alt="" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4950" class="size-full wp-image-4950" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" src="../ORI/Punalippu/Images/2024-03-02T18-13-99/000001.jpg" srcset="../ORI/Punalippu/Images/2024-03-02T18-13-99/000001.jpg" width="238"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4950">Palestine activists at the Parliament House. Activists shouted: “Free, free Palestine! End of the arms trade! ” Screenshot from a video downloaded by Sumud on Facebook.</p></div><p>The bourgeois media boasts that they are following "journalistic criteria", which claims to act as a "power watchdog" and always find out both. Stubb's inauguration again shows that these are just beautiful words.</p><p>In the Finnish media that took a video of Alexander Stubb's inauguration, uninterrupted screams were heard "Lahtari!". In a high video, these are clearly heard<a href="https://areena.yle.fi/1-68240012">From the parliamentary house</a>that<a href="https://areena.yle.fi/1-68241022">From the Presidential Palace</a>. In the IS-HS video, these have been recorded quite clearly on the Presidential Palace (<a href="https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000010262992.html">live tracking</a>, the said video clip can be found at 1:06 pm).</p><p>A typical way to ignore the matter was the phrase of "audience's cry in the background" or "People cry," Thanks Saul! " And "good luck Alex!". Covering attempts are even more awkward when IS-HS's video includes when Stubb says, "Chair is someone in Palestine…", after which Stubb and Niinistö get serious. The whole word exchange of men is not in the video, but Niinistö apparently asks, "Where?", Because after a short conversation, Stubb bow to show with his hand to Niinistö, where the protesters are located. The presidents, or mostly startling Stubb, continued to speak, but the words stand out very badly. The protesters gave a true moral impact.</p><div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4951" style="width: 650px"><img alt="" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4951" class="size-full wp-image-4951" decoding="async" height="360" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="../ORI/Punalippu/Images/2024-03-02T18-13-99/000002.jpg" srcset="../ORI/Punalippu/Images/2024-03-02T18-13-99/000002.jpg" width="640"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4951">Stubb shows Niinistö protesters. Screenshot from HS-IS video.</p></div><p>However<a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20077149/64-3-213140">In all</a>: "Some of the audience has presumably brought to Gaza's war sheets that read" Combat now "." This apparently refers to activists, of which the Sumud-Finland Palestinian Network<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sumud.fin/videos/finnish-activists-greeted-the-new-and-outgoing-president-of-finland-on-friday-13/946464160256707/">has reported</a>. No pictures in the bourgeois media were shared, or it was not stated that "bay!" Screams echoed from the audience. Mostly, some lower -level right -wing politicians have terrified protesters in words, pictures and videos on social media.</p><p>Instead, all the attention of the press was created by creating a public opinion on behalf of Stubb. For example, evening messages have such things: "Tarja and Kaitsu Seinäjoki came to tell greetings from Stubb to Ostrobothnia", "Young men want to write three points in the spirit of Stubb." Yle, in turn, describes the feelings of two classmates: "Young people think Saul is wonderful, but the exchange is confident". Iltalehti's most read-read stuff included Iltalehti's entertainment editorial for "expert attention from Stubb's costume" and "Such outfits with Jenni Haukio and Suzanne Innes-Stubb".</p><p>As for politics, the only voice in the bourgeois media is that "Stubb has grown into presidential", which means giving him a full blessing. This corresponds to a central growth story for the Stubb campaign, the bourgeois media of which immediately started at the start of the Stubb election campaign. If another voice has appeared, it is a distress about the receding of the "beloved leader" of Niinistö, but this does not challenge Stubb's presidentiality.</p><p>The closest "criticality" rose as Iltalehti reporter<a href="https://www.iltalehti.fi/politiikka/a/d9b10e96-330e-4a9f-bf90-a567c3cfaeb5">asked</a>At the end of the briefing from Stubb: "Are you now more concerned about Finland's security than a presidential candidate?" Iltalehti titled "Stubb's historical press conference ended with a surprising question," and the bread text says, "The question surprised Stubb." However, Stubb did not shy away from answering this question. This is what the bourgeois media "at its most critical" came. Why not ask the recent president, what does he think of the protesters on the market square? Because the media wanted to silence this.</p><p>The whole thing is a picture that emphasizes fictional people's unanimity - or at least passive acceptance - on behalf of Stubb, and much of the attention is even focused on completely empty issues while politically blessed with Stubb's president. In this way, the bourgeois media supports Stubb, whose first mission as president is to create an apparent and false unity of the whole people under their own presidency. The media does not act as a "power watchdog", but its lap dog, and its communication is very one -sided. This is despite the fact that even the bourgeois media has occasionally raised critical notes that the president is a very high power, but beyond the reach of democratic control - wouldn't the media do for democracy would fulfill its own role as a "power watchdog"? Its pious "of its journalistic criteria" appears to be very hypocritical again.</p><p>We want to underline that bourgeois media cannot invoke the lack of reliable knowledge or to the fact that it would not be alleged to be of interest to Finnish readers-the most common claims that it presents as an excuse for its weak and Israel-minded Palestinian news. In Stubb's inauguration, the media itself was present, so it was guaranteed to have reliable information. The protest was, at least to the extent that Stubb himself paid attention to the Presidential Palace balcony. For example, the interest in the news is that the coalition politician Otto Sea<a href="https://x.com/OttoMeri/status/1763555613814960194">update</a>The message service at X attracted over a thousand likes a day. Does it have any excuses for its unilateral news from Stubb's inauguration?</p><p>The real reason is that the media simply wants to give a particular narrative of Stubb's inauguration, and it is: "The whole people, the wandering of Niinistö, unanimously supports Stubb, or at least accepts it." Not reported by political protests, the President's "non -political", corporative character and, accordingly, Stubb's first mission as a new president.</p><p>At the same time, the media line must be set in context. On the one hand, we have to see the relationship between the silence of the media and police refrigeration. For Stubb's inauguration, a huge amount of police officers had been mobilized to handle traffic and security arrangements, but there was no interference with protesting. There are several reasons for this. It may still be good to say to Finnish media that it is not good to report because Russia closely follows Finland's internal conflicts, but for the international media that was there, one cannot say that "do not report any distortion" - this would have set Finland's entire Democratic facade questionable in the eyes of international media. Protesting was also so small that the police considered the police attack to give it more attention and thus support the goals of the protesters. Even the fact should not be underestimated that when the protesters are among the rest of the audience, it would have been difficult for the police to properly target their strokes properly. Thus, the horizontal cup turned against the police attack. When the protest could not be suppressed by violence, the bourgeois media played its own role in the right way by silent it. On the other hand, the context should be seen that even though the protest was so significant that the president himself reacted, it remained so small that it could easily be silent. Given those contexts, the bourgeois media information line is part of the class struggle.</p><p>Finally, it must be underlined that the conscious activity of the recession, which sought to avoid a minor distortion in the fictional consensus of the nation, once again confirms that, although the President of the Republic has taken off the preferences, it has maintained its absolute position as the highest political institution in bourgeois Finland. This confirms the assessment of the importance of the President of the Republic.</p></div>

The capitalist-imperialist system takes on the historical rematch and with its fierce attack it crushes the rights and conquests of centuries, at the same time as it is broken by unparalleled impasses and contradictions. The general character of his crisis consists of engaging in the economic crisis with the competition of the imperialist forces for the world's reunion and this is what is expressed on the multiple warm fronts of confrontation around the world, with a leading field of unjust war on Ukraine. This conflict, between the US and the West regime and Russian imperialism, is clear that it has put global developments in a war orbit, with the basic imperialist forces on the planet having entered a "preparedness" phase and preparation for "preparedness" a generalized massacre.</p><p>The dangerous developments in our region, focusing on the Zionist genocide that is taking place at the expense of the Palestinian people, confirm this. More so, when the local dependent ruling class involves the country and the people in every way in the fire of war, expecting favor and exchanges from its imperialist bosses in its reactionary competition with the Turkish bourgeoisie.</p><p>At the same time, across the globe, the working-class moods for struggle and resistance are rushing and questioning the apparent omnipotence of the rulers. From the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people, the bursts of rage of the oppressed in imperialist metropolises, to the great and great in many respects of farmers and youth mobilizations in our country lately and the mass strike of 28/2, it turns out to be in a cycle of struggles, outbursts and uprisings. The top task of any revolutionary power is the contribution to turn this cycle into a new cycle of reconstruction of the revolutionary communist movement.</p><p>A prerequisite for this, however, is the overcoming of the perceptions of the defeat, the perceptions on the basis of which the leftist revolutionary forces are pushed into the tail of reformism and ultimately to the alignment behind the policies and forces of the system:</p><p>The bourgeois theorem of globalization, with its various variations in the theories of "capitalist integration". A view that continues to dominate the Left, at the same time that the reality of the exacerbation of contradictions and imperialist competitions.</p><p>In relation to the previous one, the notion that capitalism continues to play a historically progressive role, with the consequence of the unconditional and boundaries of the supposed modern potential that generates the capitalist-imperialist system. Let us be taught by the opponent's comrades, but it does not do us good at all when we proclaim his narratives to a guide to the new communist reconstruction!</p><p>The theory of productive forces and the "scientific revolution", which replaces the pioneering role of class struggle in historical-social evolution by the view that communism will emerge as a ... overrun fruit from the achievements of science and technology.</p><p>The logic of searching for "ecstasies" on the central political scene, parliamentary cretinism, the infinite electoral plans that operate at the expense of the real movement, electoral welds against the real coordination of forces, the rule of transitional programs.</p><p>Comrades and comrades,</p><p>For the KKE (M-L) it is clear that the reconstitution of the labor-revolutionary-communist movement will not emerge with old materials, even if they are baptized "new" and "innovative"!</p><p>We believe that with our joint action and coordination we can contribute to strengthen the direction of the resistance and claim, which will win, shake urban sovereignty, open ways for more overall reversals. On this basis, and as you know, we have submitted a proposal of frontal coordination and joint action against the basic fronts facing the working people and the youth in the autumn of 2022. On this basis we seek consistently joint action initiatives in terms of open and democratic political understanding within the movement and between the forces referring to it, far from hegemonic and micro -political perceptions and against the elements of degeneration that unfortunately appear more and more often.</p><p>With these thoughts we welcome your 5th Congress and wish his work to contribute and promote the working class case</p><div style="clear: both;"></div></br></div>

<div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-8735462159755033652" itemprop="description articleBody"><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>WINNING IN THE RIGHT OF TELEPERFORMANCE EMPLOYEES</b></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="4961" data-original-width="3508" height="640" src="../ORI/Resistance in the neighbourhood/Images/2024-03-02T18-42-00-02-00/000000.jpg" srcset="../ORI/Resistance in the neighbourhood/Images/2024-03-02T18-42-00-02-00/000000.jpg" width="453"/></div><p>By the end of January, Teleperformance workers, and especially the members of the Tunisian community, started a battle demanding wage increases covering the cost of living, collective agreements and the abolition of a "special purpose" visa. So far, they have carried out two mass strikes, with more than 4,000 workers involved. They have announced to the administration that they will not stop until their requirements are met. Three members of the Tunisian community and employees of Teleperformance have answered some of our questions.</p><p><b>1.What were the first steps of this race and what were the factors that made you gather signatures by claiming wage increases?</b></p><p><b>Nour:</b></p><p>The first step was to analyze our present position in terms of our salaries and labor rights in the company. It is important to mention that the initiative did not start with a person who said "here" but was a collective view we shared. The signature collection started from Facebook and a colleague, T and then collected over 760 signatures. This struggle brought together workers who shared the same concerns and the same frustration. I am personally in the company since 2017 for exactly the same salary, which has fueled my insistence on talking about the need to make a change. In addition, as a member of the Tunisian community, I know that many other members of the community working in respective companies have similar issues. We have begun collecting signatures as a collective effort to deal with this inequality and to ensure a fair compensation for all employees. Later, Ta suggested that we address SETIP that helped us and guided us about the course we would take to demand justice from the company.</p><p><b>Sami:</b></p><p>Initially I actively sought to negotiate for fair compensation and indefinite contract, especially after being faced with increasing responsibilities but stagnant salary. Despite all our efforts to open a dialogue with the employer, we have faced a steady resistance with rejection answers that showed complete indifference to our concerns. This frustration was combined with the subsequent terrorism by the higher administration, which created a hostile work environment. Recognizing the increasing cost of living worsened by international events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, our hopes of salary increases have been repeatedly rejected. Instead, we witnessed misleading maneuvers such as the redistribution of bonuses to hide non -increase wages. The inequality in treatment, particularly evident in the privileged increases in sections that serve specific languages, have intensified feelings of frustration and discrimination. In addition, our dissatisfaction was further fueled by the unparalleled promise of indefinite contracts. These systemic issues prompted us to act and motivated the distribution of a memorandum that resonated with a wide range of colleagues, including supervisors and HR workers, reflecting a common sense of frustration and frustration.</p><p><b>S.B.:</b></p><p>The reasons are obvious to everyone, and they are not just our inflation or our financial situation, but common sense. For over 10 years now, Teleperformance has not made salaries. Then things were better but no longer. Even with a slight increase in salary, the loss of life costs has done to be covered. It's not just a request, it's vital.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="210" data-original-width="280" height="300" src="../ORI/Resistance in the neighbourhood/Images/2024-03-02T18-42-00-02-00/000001.jpg" srcset="../ORI/Resistance in the neighbourhood/Images/2024-03-02T18-42-00-02-00/000001.jpg" width="400"/></div><p><br/></p><p><b>2.What are your requests and why?</b></p><p><b>Nour:</b></p><p>Our main demand from the management of Teleperformance is fair salaries that reflect the value of our work as well as the cost of living. I have been a company employee for 6.5 years without any increase, despite the inflation we have been experiencing in recent years in Greece that has influenced rents, food and other basic daily expenses. It is also important to emphasize that the majority of us have fixed -term contracts. This intensifies uncertainty and volatility in our working status. This emphasizes the need to increase wages and fairly dealing with all employees. In addition, other collective demands resulted in our first meeting with SETIP. These requests were later translated into a letter we sent to the Department of Human Resources of Teleperformance, which was the first step. As part of this collective struggle, I address the employer wanting to be a worker. It should be self -evident that the company should take care of its employees and guarantee their dignity and rights!</p><p><b>Sami:</b></p><p>Requests are rooted in the urgent need for fair treatment and working conditions:</p><p>-Excounting wages that covers the cost of living</p><p>-Derection of indefinite time for workers with some service</p><p>-Exclared wages as much as employees remain in the company</p><p>-Fu</p><p>-Priminal medical insurance</p><p>-Importing direct communication between the company's lawyers and the aliens department for residence permit issues</p><p>-The re -stake for workers who closed their departments</p><p>-Callew Camp for employees</p><p>-A Paid day of leave per menstrual cycle for women employees</p><p>-Clean and well -enlightened workplaces</p><p>-Side to cover shipping for workers working in the offices</p><p>-Dean parking for employees</p><p>-Pinner of the advantages package</p><p>—Pinsement of the offering offered in the office such as gym and room for siesta</p><p>-Caying of group activities for staff</p><p>These demands, some of which were accepted but subsequently recalled, are essential for the preservation of the well -being and morale of the workers, especially amidst the present financial difficulties and uncertainties.</p><p><b>S.B.:</b></p><p>The demand for wage increases is self -evident, companies around the world give annual increases in their employees' salaries. This request does not arise from nowhere but is a logical and fair claim. Beyond that, we are seeking indefinite contracts and the abolition of a special purpose visa. Otherwise it is simply a modern slave trade and economic discrimination within the EU, which otherwise gives human rights lectures.</p><p><b>3. Do you think the two strikes on February 8 and 19 were successful?</b></p><p><b>Nour:</b></p><p>Although the strikes on February 8 and 19 were significant signs of unity and determination among workers, their essential victory will eventually depend on whether the employer will take steps to satisfy our demands or if it will continue to ignore our rights . I believe we have already won the strikes as this race became something of nothing existing.</p><p><b>Sami:</b></p><p>The two strikes on February 8 and 19 marked significantly milestones in our collective struggle, and served as an exemplary shift to the strengthening of workers and solidarity. The strikes have managed to break up chronic fears of retaliation and encouraged a large number of workers to openly express their dissatisfaction. Significant participation in meetings of the Association, coupled with the increased registration of workers, emphasized the absolute commitment to conquering tangible changes.</p><p>In addition, the strikes were characterized by a peaceful and disciplined approach, reflecting a coordinated attempt to comply with legal and moral standards.</p><p><b>S.B.:</b></p><p>The strikes were a huge success, especially with the knowledge that the employer never expected that this could happen. It is the first time that workers have been so massively strike in these companies, and of course it will not be the last. The administration advertises that its doors are open to workers (which is not the case of course) but now we will remove the doors completely and make them listen to us.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="210" data-original-width="280" height="300" src="../ORI/Resistance in the neighbourhood/Images/2024-03-02T18-42-00-02-00/000002.jpg" srcset="../ORI/Resistance in the neighbourhood/Images/2024-03-02T18-42-00-02-00/000002.jpg" width="400"/></div><p><b>4. How did the employer attempt to intimidate the workers in order to push them not to participate in the race that has erupted?</b></p><p><b>Nour:</b></p><p>The employer is trying to intimidate workers by misinforming the legality of SETP, trying to sow doubt. They have also attempted to split us by depicting the strikes as harmful to the interests of the company. Nevertheless, we remain united in our purpose and refuse to terrorize and sneeze! We will not prevent these tactics and we will continue to fight for our labor rights!</p><p><b>Sami:</b></p><p>Employers' efforts to prevent workers in the ongoing race were characterized by misinformation and coercion. Some members of the administration resorted to the dissemination of unfounded rumors regarding the legality of the strikes and the possible impact on workers involved, including threats to bonus withholding and unjustified absence.</p><p>In addition, there were cases of targeted discussions aimed at instilling fear and uncertainty in terms of terms in our contracts and our performance measurements. However, these tactics have led to the strengthening of the determination and unity of workers in the struggle for justice!</p><p><b>S.B.:</b></p><p>Personally, no one tried to intimidate me, but I have heard stories from colleagues. I was expecting a company like Teleperformance to do what it says in its brochures but what seems to be that everything is lies and propaganda. I am terribly frustrated by the company and the management. And I would like to emphasize that it is not okay when workers live under the fear of the threats of dismissal. We are no longer working on Teleperformance because it is "The Best Place to Work", but because we have no other options as we are under special purpose visa, which employers are using against us.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="126" data-original-width="280" height="180" src="../ORI/Resistance in the neighbourhood/Images/2024-03-02T18-42-00-02-00/000003.jpg" srcset="../ORI/Resistance in the neighbourhood/Images/2024-03-02T18-42-00-02-00/000003.jpg" width="400"/></div><br><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>5. What do you have to say to workers who may be afraid to participate in strikes?</b></p><p><b>Nour:</b></p><p>To anyone who is afraid to participate, I want to emphasize this: He is not alone in it. Your participation is necessary to ensure our collective success. The strike is legal in Greece and no need to suffer silence. Our steps are well organized and you can become part of our race. Also, SETIP has set up a strike fund that can help if the loss of the paycheck is something that holds someone from strike.</p><p><b>Sami:</b></p><p>Employees who are hesitant to take part in the strikes because of fear, I understand your concerns and recognize the natural fear related to the controversy of the status quo. However, it is important to recognize that collective action is necessary to bring about a substantial change. Rest assured that your participation contributes to a fairer working environment and sets a precedent for future efforts to defend our rights. In addition, the solidarity shown during the first strike has demystified many of the tactics of bullying, emphasizing the power of unity in dealing with injustice.</p><p><b>S.B.:</b></p><p>It is not worth living under such fear. Since there is this fear the problem has the employer, not you. This means that they want us frightened to control us and make us feel that we are not enough and that we are at their mercy. Now no one is alone and together we will not be scared because we have each other.</p><p><b>6. What is your opinion on Teleperformance against SETP?</b></p><p><b>Nour:</b></p><p>Teleperformance's lawsuit against SETEP is a clear attempt to suppress our right to organize and support a fair approach to our workplace. It is a blatant indifference to our basic labor rights. We reject all the attempts at bullying from the employer and remain stable in our commitment to fight for salaries and rights! We are not going to retreat!</p><p><b>Sami</b>:</p><p>Teleperformance's decision to initiate legal procedures against SETIP reflects an inappropriate attempt to stifle reactions and delay resolution. The company has used similar tactics in other countries around the world and have proven in vain, which highlights the futility of such conflict approaches. Instead of being involved in prolonged litigation, it would be better for the employer to deal with existing complaints on a constructive basis, thus creating a more harmonious and productive work environment.</p><p><b>S.B.:</b></p><p>It is still a maneuver, an attempt to make us lose our hope. It is sad that a company is "seeking justice" when nothing is just about them. It's like they don't treat us as humans. Maybe they should remember Spartacus.</p><p><b>7. How do you see the evolution of this race prospects and what steps do you consider to be Nikiforos?</b></p><p><b>Nour</b>:</p><p>The evolution of our struggle depends on our constant unity, determination and resilience to adversity. We must remain organized and focused on our goals, despite the efforts of the employer to derail our efforts. Going on, we need to escalate our actions, continuing the strikes and with collective bargaining with the employer. Victory requires perseverance and solidarity between workers, as well as a commitment that the employer is accountable for its actions.</p><p><b>Sami</b>:</p><p>As we move on to this struggle, it is necessary to maintain our momentum and solidarity but also to recognize the difficulties in the confrontation with a large company. Overcoming fear and dismissing any misunderstandings about our labor rights are basic steps to achieve our goals. We must remain firm in our demands and recognize that substantial change often requires perseverance and sacrifices. By being united and claiming our collective prosperity we can pave the way for a better and fairer future for all workers.</p><p><b>S.B</b>.:</p><p>This is just the beginning. It is a great test for us, but we are ready and we will go to the end because all we ask for is justice and dignity. Whatever they do they won't crush our morale</p><p><br/></p><div style="clear: both;"></div></br></div>

<div itemprop="articleBody"><p style="text-align: justify;">Last June, Minister of Ele Minister Hubertus Heil and the valued Foreign Minister Baerbock traveled through Brazil for a few days to make a hunt for cheap workforce. The program included a visit to a training center for nursing professions, a visit to the Oswaldo-Cruz Hospital including an encounter with nursing staff, and a conversation with Heil's counterpart Luiz Marinho.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At that time, the Federal Employment Agency looked after 374 Brazilian applicants from nursing professions, 43 from technical and craft professions and 42 from engineering and IT professions; 200 would work in nursing professions. According to Heil, she considers 700 new a year to be possible. Every eighth nurse in Germany came from abroad in 2021, which is over 200,000 - 120,000 of them from outside the EU; The value of the migrants of other continents has significantly increased against Eastern European care in recent years. The example of the nursing staff shows that it is particularly women who no longer help an academic conclusion in an oppressed nation to have a more pleasant life there, but are only a privilege as a springboard to the imperialist countries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/vor-ort/zav/projects-programs/health-and-care/brasil-enfermeiros/recrutamentos">With the Federal Employment Agency, German hospital representatives can travel to Brazil and advertise their vacancies</a>; A little later, numerous applicants come to Germany to visit the clinics, according to which they can then select who they set. In 2023, this included the university clinics Bonn and Braunschweig and several Helios clinics in Germany. In four years, 640 foreign workers from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Indonesia have already been recruited at the Berlin flagship hospital in Charité.<a href="/index.php/de/12-dokumente/7034-rote-post-bremen-importiert-mexikanische-pflegekraefte">The situation of Mexican nurses in a Bremen clinic was also reported in the Red Post.</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Heil always speaks of a "win-win situation" because Brazil supposedly has a surplus of nurses. It is only reminded here of the first months of covid pandemic, where Brazil was hit the hardest due to its completely dilapidated health system and bureaucratic capitalism murdered hundreds of thousands. What propagates in Brazil in Brazil had already given the best three months earlier in Ghana. According to the German government, too, there is supposedly a surplus of skilled workers here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Image: Heil and Baerbock in the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Those: Bmas.de)</span></em></p></div>

The association is a self-managed association, which is the oldest self-managed women’s center in Europe with over 43 years.</p><p><em>In solidarity we publish the call of the militant women and call for solidarity:</em></p><p>Dear women, lesbians, migrants!</p><p>Dear supporters of solidarity!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">OUR FIGHT FOR THE FZ AND ITS SPACES CONTINUES!</h2><p>The FZ Wien – Communication Center for Women, Lesbians, Migrants and Girls – as an autonomous feminist association in self-administration has been occupying the association’s location at Währinger Straße 59, STIEGE 6, 1090 Vienna, for 43 years now.</p><p>The FZ was and is not part of the “Werkstätten und Kulturhaus”, WUK, as many have wrongly assumed. Even the WUK states: “Not in the WUK and yet in the house” on its homepage.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">THE EXCLUSION from our rooms:</h3><p>On April 11, 2023, the rooms were simply locked by the city/MA34 in the course of the renovation of the building and handed over to the WUK on April 23, 2023, instead of the FZ! On April 24, 2023, the FZ was immediately BLOCKED OUT of all rooms on Stiege 6 by WUK and meticulously monitored to ensure that no one from the FZ could enter the rooms, unless WUK first allowed individual women accompanied by security into the rooms by appointment, which were then immediately locked again. In the end, the WUK management even demanded a police escort for such steps, which were necessary for the FZ!!! Our things are still on Stiege 6.</p><p>Not only the FZ classifies the WUK as a compliant administrator of neoliberal reconstruction in the interests of the City of Vienna. Some people have already figured out what’s going on. Those who don’t parry and submit to the imposed conditions, who don’t sign and pay: CAN GO OR JUST GET OUT! So this is what the much vaunted “protection of the WUK through a rental agreement” now looks like in practice.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">OUR LAWSUIT:</h3><p>THE FZ filed an action for disturbance of possession against the CITY OF VIENNA AS PROPERTY OWNER and against the WUK against this lockout in due time, but after 3 hearings and a duration of !!!! 10 months!!! did not get the rooms back for the time being. Of course, after many months without rooms for the necessary work – the renovation of Stiege 6 has been running since July 4, 2022! – high costs not only for the legal representation – and our urgent request is therefore:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">SUPPORT US IN SOLIDARITY WITH DEEDS AND WITH DONATIONS.</h3><p>Donation target = € 16.000,– Euro for the proceedings and further (repair) work that we have to do in our center: Fine plastering, painting (930m² rooms), laying fireproof floor etc.</p><p>Should the legal fees be waived because we win the appeal, we would use your donations for the renovation and operation, including advertising. Items stolen from the rooms must also be repurchased, etc.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">OUR PETITION:</h3><p>Please support our ongoing petition and receive more detailed information by e-mail after signing. FZ BLEIBT!<a href="https://mein.aufstehn.at/petitions/fz-bleibt">https://mein.aufstehn.at/petitions/fz-bleibt</a>– so that the responsible city councillor and the mayor know that we are not alone! You will receive news about news, actions, solidarity, events, etc. from us! Until we are back in our rooms!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">OUR APPEAL AGAINST THE DECISION:</h3><p>WE ARE CLEARLY FILING AN APPEAL against this miserable FINAL DECISION of the JOSEFSTADT COURT at the regional court!</p><p>WE ARE ON THE BARRICADE FOR OUR CENTER – 43 YEARS OF FZ IN WÄHRINGER STRASSE 59 ON STIEGE 6 – once again summarizing the reasons for the escalation:</p><p>The FZ moved into the rooms of Stiege 6 in 1981 with the express intention and concept of establishing a feminist center exclusively for women and lesbians, which succeeded with a lot of effort and patience and many, many feminists. This was also clear to the WUK and the federal government. (The federal government handed over the property to the City of Vienna, which also knew about the FZ, by means of an exchange agreement in 1988). The FZ was never part of the WUK association, never a member of the WUK, as many people mistakenly think! “Not in the WUK and yet in the house” – that’s what the WUK itself calls us in its newspaper and on its website.</p><p>Today, the FZ is one of the last large women’s centers in the whole of Europe, autonomous and feminist and still self-managed! The work at the FZ is done on a voluntary basis and without subsidies, there is no commercialization of the rooms and no pressure to consume in our communication space. We offer women, lesbians, girls and migrants spaces for large and small projects at affordable cost contributions… During all the time of the construction site and the lockdown and without rooms of the FZ, our work was continued: by the artists in external rooms, international feminist structures were maintained, feminist self-defense was continued, feminist commemoration and artistic, musical activities as well as demo preparations in addition to all the strenuous work on the process for disturbance of property were carried out during this time and will continue to be done… The rooms are ours and we will have them back!</p><p>In contrast, the WUK after the signing of the lease: However, in 2020, during the Corona period, the WUK association with its 180 (!) employees signed a “lease” with the city (MA 34, on behalf of the then city councellor Michael Ludwig), which was negotiated in strict secrecy over the FZ and Stiege 6 association, although such a procedure is legally wrong and completely impossible. And has always been publicly rejected by the FZ! The WUK has never owned the entire building and nobody can simply sign a rental agreement for the neighbor’s home and then present a “loan agreement” with horrendously estimated costs (for the FZ) for signature! The WUK is highly subsidized and also receives subsidies from the City of Vienna for the operating costs of the entire building.</p><p>However, the WUK board went through with this loan agreement for the FZ with the approval of the assembled members of the WUK, contrary to all previous assurances that “everything will remain as it is” for the FZ, in the knowledge that the FZ has no funding. With the intention of negative consequences for the FZ, this is clear to see! And the City of Vienna is determined to subordinate the FZ to the WUK by means of this rental agreement. The city’s interest is to commercialize the building and control the groups in it. That’s why some groups and people have already left the WUK… The WUK – as it is also called by people in the WUK itself – is the administration for the neoliberal restructuring of the conditions for the users of this public building. Gentrification is everything at the moment.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">I N F O R M A T I O N S on the situation of the FZ:</h3><p>The FZ website contains more details about the course of this whole neoliberal attack on the Women’s Center after so many years<a href="http://www.frauenlesbenzentrum-wien.at/">www.frauenlesbenzentrum-wien.at</a></p><p>And our BANKING LINK for your solidarity DONATIONS for the lawyer and legal costs is:</p><p>Bank Austria/Unicredit Group, account no.

<h1>"Tren Maya"/Mexico: A deadly mega project in the service of the imperialists</h1>
<hr/>
Author: Maria L.
<br/>
Description: The so-called "Maya train" (Spanish: Tren Maya) is celebrated as a prestige project by the ruling Mexico. However, behind this beautifully sounding name is a fatal mega project by the imperialists, a million grave at the expense of the population and the environment. There is therefore a great resistance on the part of the people, especially of the indigenous people, who rightly reject mega projects such as the "Tren Maya" as an attack on their livelihood and their democratic rights

The construction costs already exceed 2.5 times the original costs (from $ 7.4 billion to just under 20 billion), which are to be squeezed from the pockets of the population by means of tax - to increase the profits of foreign corporations. The train is not even intended for the transportation of the population, but in order to further boost the tourism that is already completely overdue in this region.

Eleven kilometers of the "Maya train" are laid by the jungle, at the same time in this section one of the world's most complex and sensitive cave systems is located. Knowing that this project is completely whipped against the interests of the population, the prevailing Mexico has already prepared for hard resistance and the management of the entire project has given the military.

It means the opposite of real industrialization or an economic upswing, but an even greater subordination and exploitation of the soil and the population through foreign capital. The prevailing Mexicos take on the role as a henchman compared to the interests of foreign monopolies. The revolutionary newspaper "Mural" from Mexico sums up this relationship well:</span><span style="font-style:italic"><span>“This example helps us to understand the phenomenon of bureaucratic capitalism in the oppressed countries (…) science, technology, the means of production, production itself, imports and capital are owned by imperialism and its private profit, while exports and commercialization The task will be Mexico, with a mega project that will expand the "Maya train" and the Interocean corridor with a train system everywhere.

This corridor must be referred to as a "giga project", because it is de facto of 12 mega projects that are supposed to connect the Atlantic and the Pacific through a freight train route. In summary, these projects threaten the entire south of Mexico and are based on the economic interests of the imperialist monopolies.

The capitalist-imperialist system takes on the historical rematch and with its fierce attack it crushes the rights and conquests of centuries, at the same time as it is broken by unparalleled impasses and contradictions. The general character of his crisis consists of engaging in the economic crisis with the competition of the imperialist forces for the world's reunion and this is what is expressed on the multiple warm fronts of confrontation around the world, with a leading field of unjust war on Ukraine. This conflict, between the US and the West regime and Russian imperialism, is clear that it has put global developments in a war orbit, with the basic imperialist forces on the planet having entered a "preparedness" phase and preparation for "preparedness" a generalized massacre.</p><p>The dangerous developments in our region, focusing on the Zionist genocide that is taking place at the expense of the Palestinian people, confirm this. More so, when the local dependent ruling class involves the country and the people in every way in the fire of war, expecting favor and exchanges from its imperialist bosses in its reactionary competition with the Turkish bourgeoisie.</p><p>At the same time, across the globe, the working-class moods for struggle and resistance are rushing and questioning the apparent omnipotence of the rulers. From the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people, the bursts of rage of the oppressed in imperialist metropolises, to the great and great in many respects of farmers and youth mobilizations in our country lately and the mass strike of 28/2, it turns out to be in a cycle of struggles, outbursts and uprisings. The top task of any revolutionary power is the contribution to turn this cycle into a new cycle of reconstruction of the revolutionary communist movement.</p><p>A prerequisite for this, however, is the overcoming of the perceptions of the defeat, the perceptions on the basis of which the leftist revolutionary forces are pushed into the tail of reformism and ultimately to the alignment behind the policies and forces of the system:</p><p>The bourgeois theorem of globalization, with its various variations in the theories of "capitalist integration". A view that continues to dominate the Left, at the same time that the reality of the exacerbation of contradictions and imperialist competitions.</p><p>In relation to the previous one, the notion that capitalism continues to play a historically progressive role, with the consequence of the unconditional and boundaries of the supposed modern potential that generates the capitalist-imperialist system. Let us be taught by the opponent's comrades, but it does not do us good at all when we proclaim his narratives to a guide to the new communist reconstruction!</p><p>The theory of productive forces and the "scientific revolution", which replaces the pioneering role of class struggle in historical-social evolution by the view that communism will emerge as a ... overrun fruit from the achievements of science and technology.</p><p>The logic of searching for "ecstasies" on the central political scene, parliamentary cretinism, the infinite electoral plans that operate at the expense of the real movement, electoral welds against the real coordination of forces, the rule of transitional programs.</p><p>Comrades and comrades,</p><p>For the KKE (M-L) it is clear that the reconstitution of the labor-revolutionary-communist movement will not emerge with old materials, even if they are baptized "new" and "innovative"!</p><p>We believe that with our joint action and coordination we can contribute to strengthen the direction of the resistance and claim, which will win, shake urban sovereignty, open ways for more overall reversals. On this basis, and as you know, we have submitted a proposal of frontal coordination and joint action against the basic fronts facing the working people and the youth in the autumn of 2022. On this basis we seek consistently joint action initiatives in terms of open and democratic political understanding within the movement and between the forces referring to it, far from hegemonic and micro -political perceptions and against the elements of degeneration that unfortunately appear more and more often.</p><p>With these thoughts we welcome your 5th Congress and wish his work to contribute and promote the working class case</p></div>

A paraphrase of an exhausted old punch, which burns unjustly aspects of a remarkable rural uprising against the strategic targeting of the capitalist staff for the outbreak? Or to be a vulgar methodology of subversive forces against the calculative, multi -day mobilizations of the poor farm?<br><br>On one side of the half -plain plain because of accuracy of agrarian and fuel, degrading prices on the products, farming CAP, a tskromomas, tax, bad weather, the indignation of the pinking hands is wildly sailed. Opposite to her, the armors are shaken as lobster steering wheel in the country, following a completely fair behavior. Do not make the slightest distinction. That is to say, the relentless attack on all the strata of those who are struggling to secure a honest manner in a honest manner, stress, anxiety, fear of physical army or loser of life itself (labor murders, crimes in temporis, waterfalls).<span><a name="more"></a></span><br><br>But at some distance a few years of light beyond, right there in the small flock of blue -blooded giggling, the landscape is shifting. At that time, the bottom of the barrel of poverty that torments the social majority is frantically scratched and any harvesting is heading for the overflowing of the golden scum of the legal mafia of the aristocrats. By magic, the budgetary space (miserable wording of the people's looting) is expanding wasteful for the sake of the dominant parasitic order.<br><br/>Infinite affection for capital and no compassion for the plagues. Let his child be starving and let his child be unable to pay the cost of studies in public (and under the abolition of free) universities. Every patient has to respond to the excruciating dilemma, if paying afternoon surgeries and being heal will then die of hunger or vice versa. Unless luxury exists for both. It was out of work and kneeling from the black -haired accuracy, continued, we were breathing, to sigh in the arena of exploitation by completing the coins of the pension.<br/><br/>On the contrary, all the previous sacrifices of the following and for the good of the "development of the place" must be transformed into profitability, mythical vigor and bourgeois investment privileges. Also - especially in our time - in dizzying costs of supplying torsion disaster (here instead of barrels, we find lakes full of sweaty workers) and participation in war adventures of the planet's chiefs. Probably the interests of the biomass are so distant and huge that they not only touch the EEZs, but by "engaging" with those shipowners, industrialists and bankers (those with household evictions) travel to the Red Sea or Ukraine. Thus serving the neo -Nazis Zionists and American imperialists and contributing to the bloodshed of the Palestinian resistance against the usurpers of the land !!<br/><br/>So in this rule of the misery of the masses (and the prosperity of the bosses) there is no exception. Not even for those who feed the population producing tedious wheat, fruit and vegetables and oil. The farmer in the name of concentration (neo -pilgrims), supplying the agro -industrial sector with cheap raw material and harmonization with European orders must simply be erased. Always perforated excuses and green unkinds.<br/><br/>So the one -way street of the farmers' struggle was again hunting for their prosperity, but seeking anxiously the viable stay in the fields. Despite this, the curtain of this year's significant controversy of modern collapse with the government has fallen for many, in a row. The prime minister's epitheliums are silently in order not to cause (no substantial retreat), triumphantly. On the part of the farmers again, the classic, stupid juniors of a success-related success of the problem (did we ignore it?), Achievement of social acceptance-sympathy, partnership with other European colleagues.<br/><br/>What were these and how radical or threatening were there for the implementation of anti -grocery plans? Better let the official and non -enthusiasts of the enemies of the people comment.<br/><br/>The preacher of the gang of the exploitation-exhaustion-ragation of Proderdis from the television pulpit sends the Sycharics to its organizers (and) a motorized "long course" from the country's dying to its heart, the Constitution. Something dirty probably smells of guidance, when a sworn warrior of social majority rights praises. Mostly when Mitsotakis receives the baton of the begging, applauding (instead of being) the "prudent" manipulations at all stages for weeks of mobilization.<br/><br/>And how not to reward the attitude of the fronts, when the exclusions of national roads - despite the line -up of hundreds of tractors at their edges and the tired of base dissatisfaction - were minimal and time from ten minutes to the very two -hour (usually for trucks) . Such parody forms of action, even centuries, would not have a trace of pressure on the makers. Symbolic theatricals against a scent, sweeping outing.<br/><br/>In the other, the president of the Attica Police Officers' Association is not flattering to the heads of all protests for excellent cooperation with the authorities (and so -called electoral left of the capitulation of the "Children of the People", who "randomly and detailed" tears) with the aim of limiting the upheaval of the residents of Athens and a short -circuit of the smooth functioning of the Teratoupolis.<br/><br/>Indeed, the "prestigious" farm is taking off the climate of mutual abundance, calling for police protection of the rally from possible slander of turbulent circles within the peaceful body of the protesters !! The real -minded images where the Mattzis were piercing tractors or welcomed the "invaders" farmers with beatings and chemicals in the Piraeus port, as well as various other similar civil war, now belong to the immediate past. Perhaps the uninterrupted accompaniment of tractors with patrols all the way to the national roads and in their one lane "of course" (so as not to suffer the otherwise carefree, charged people) to have the character of a class solidarity.<br/><br/>Also heard in the misinformation and disintegration newsletters (and most likely would apply) that it was requested (and was it given?) Named list of tractors for disciplines !! Pity. This "anti -labor" perception leads the employees of the unemployment mechanisms.<br/><br/>It was also rumored that the prime minister was swinging by the dilemma to the concentration by the last minute, expressing a full understanding of the serious difficulties of the primary sector. Eventually, however, it was limited to the long -term expression of sympathy for their justified reactions, but also to the clear reluctance of baking from demands, beyond the original crumbs. Fortunately, the gap was overwhelmed by the presence of other politicians and tested, fiery therapists (such as SYRIZA) of the EU Agrotheraki.<br/><br/>In the past, the state -owned rage, prosecutors and threats, arrests and agricultural courts, orgy muddle of silver journalists, accusations of political motivation, activation of social automation. Nowadays and in the initial phase, such practices have definitely mediated, but to a milder degree. Regardless of the well-known rails of the representatives of the peasantry, the aura of a non-electrified atmosphere between the two camps (government-peasants) were passed by, since the carrot was honored. Raising the reasonable question about the mysterious and somewhere in the superb origin of the causes of malice (poverty and extrusion in abandonment of this particular livelihood) for the mass of farmers. Or at least focusing it on the evil Cup and to God in the old never -ending core of the non -guilty (probably?) EU.<br/><br/>So we came to the time of the so -called crown and essentially ending racing actions. Such a climax, as much as similar determination, distinguished them in the past. Massively inconsistent (despite the widespread rage of farmers) of critical problems of producers and universal awareness that is no longer the improvement of the very meager income, but the inability of crops itself.<br/><br/>In forms of fighting almost velvet (the modernist introduced by the "pioneer"), bullshit and repeated from the guilty past of the conciliation. So completely powerless in blackmailing an unfaithful, cruel opponent. That is, they were the short blocks. Instead of cutting Greece in the middle, only the race was fragmented and degenerated. The note of the two -sided and deliberately uncoordinated with others with perseverance in the battle of the bishopric of the people of the people (students). A confrontation with supportive supportive and timely strike initiatives of the supposedly allies. Even the non -interconnection of agricultural problems with the anti -war (each feather of the F35 and the shipment of frigates what amounts to ELGA?) Was negative.<br/><br/>So the escalation (deciphering the vocabulary of reformism constitutes an alibi-trick of the definitive resignation) has performed its destination as the figure of the figure of the finishing sale. He was registered in the rich story of the relief of anger and racing momentum. The need for non -poverty and survival pushes in the arena of the struggles, and the captains, if they honor their role, consistently justify them. Otherwise if they are epileptic, they lead them to the rocks of defeat and subsequent inactivation.<br/><br/>The blocks were reflected the adverse associations for the people, and the dynamics of the farmers to overthrow their choices by the means of the firefighters' efforts of the movement for unconditional submission. Certainly the explosiveness of the problems, its awareness of developments in combination with the encouragement - encouragement from the impressive stream of the upheaval of their colleagues in the various European primates, influenced the formation of a - relatively - right -wing. On the other hand, the chronic deconstruction and lag behind the resistance of the people, the partial unmistakation of the power of the punch, the self -evident suspicion towards trade unions.<br/><br/>Obviously the unpleasant ending of the race was not discounted. Unexpected, dirty and at the same time rough the duties of dying by the captains of a confrontation in conditions of savage attack on income and the transparent risk of extinction. In any confrontation, even folding, reaps the gain of experience - the restaurant and the reconstitution - return to the ramparts under more favorable conditions. In addition, the cost of a defeat becomes more painful if it leaves the aftertaste of an immune antiseptic and a frustrating - paralyzing impatience to be treated again with a higher organization.<br/><br/>But the veil up to the most ineffective crash has positive slits. Much more in the case where its causes are focused not on inadequate participation and non -vigorous minds, but on catalytic (and solvent) intervention within the lines of struggling forces adjacent (and worshiped) in the system. Therefore, their unblocking facilitates the reduction of the influence of such harmful factors in the future. Of course the gap (which is not automatically replaced and in the midst of inaction) of the navigation of the next racing outbursts must necessarily be covered by uncommon communist elements, focused on the goal of awakening, recruiting and exhaustion (something that did not happen now) a persistent and uninterrupted orbit. Then, even a possible failure will be fertile, as it will pregnancy the successive victorious raid away from the perpetual cycle of undermined, ineffective attempts.<br/><br/>Only the resolution of the problems of the peasantry will bring about its appeasement. With guarantors of the state, its respective managers and the EU, they will certainly worsen unbearable. At the same time, they are unintentionally guaranteed (and unfortunately for them) the submarine of the later uprising. Reconstruction of the first vital cells of the organization of the current declined agricultural associations, restoring the agricultural movement in solid, non -negotiable foundations and despising the reformist sirens of the conciliation after the end of the struggles, the farmers will not return.<br/><br/>For lucrative crops in the field, they must register with satisfactory crop in the mesters of claims. For remarkable crops in the races, they have to avoid the devastating traps of the nightmares that guard them. To get angry and revolted, they don't have to do anything. The opponents take care of this with unmistakable study.<br/><br/>Mm<div style="clear: both;"></div></br></br></br></br></br></div>
