Once again, the \u201csecurity\u201d in Congo has concern the imperialists due to the advance of the M23 group towards the regional capital, Goma. This is an important city in the D.R. of Congo, where two million people live and another half a million are displaced in the city seeking for refuge. It is believed that M23 group could be close to<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/a-guide-to-the-decades-long-conflict-in-dr-congo\"></a><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/a-guide-to-the-decades-long-conflict-in-dr-congo\">seizing</a><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/a-guide-to-the-decades-long-conflict-in-dr-congo\">the city</a>, which would mean a big blow to the Congolese government, who would lose control over the region. Already in 2012 the M23 group took<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/20/congo-rebel-m23-take-goma\">the power in Goma</a>\u201cwith nearly any resistance\u201d, as reported by other media.

On the other hand, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo demands that 13,500 soldiers and 2,000 police retire to the border of Rwanda and Burundi, despite international concerns. The militarization and repression of the country increase by the State, it that is unable to keep in line the violence of the people. After 20 years, the DRC has decided to establish the<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/congo-reinstates-death-penalty-after-20-years-struggles-108156667\">capital punishment</a>again, which, as the State itself says \u201cit will be reserved for offenders involved in criminal conspiracies, armed gangs, insurrection \u2014 and also those who commit treason and war crimes. It will also be applied to the military, including those who rebel or desert and join enemy ranks. \u201d</p><p>Since 1996, when the conflict sharped, more than six million people have died in the conflict. Only this year almost<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/-unprecedented-humanitarian-crisis-in-congo-as-conflict-rages\">one million have been forced to<u>flee</u>their homes</a>. There is also a lack of access to basic resources such as water, food, hygiene or sanitary access for those civilians who are in the middle of the crossfire between the armed groups and State and foreign repression forces. However, when the people raise up against the blue helmets for their clear pro-imperialist interest and against the people, the Congolese suffer a strong repression that leaves<a href=\"https://heraldorojo.org/tag/republica-democratica-del-congo/\">tens</a><a href=\"https://redherald.org/2023/09/12/congo-number-of-murders-in-the-demonstration-against-united-nations-operation-rises-to-100/\" title=\"\">of dead</a>in their path.</p><p>After 25 years since the beginning of MONUSCO, the UN military mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d, it has been shown that it has not served more than to ensure the interests of imperialists, mainly on mining resources, while there is still deepening in the misery of the people.</p></div>", "pdf_content": "", "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/03/31/clashes-among-the-state-forces-and-the-armed-groups-skyrocketed-in-the-dr-of-congo/", "type": "article", "title": "Clashes among the State forces and the armed groups skyrocketed in the DR of Congo \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "The confrontations between the State forces (FARDC) and the National Liberation Group March23 (M23) continue to increase in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country rich in resources dominated by the imperialists.", "modified time": "2024-03-31T20:04:17+00:00", "author": ["T.I."], "categories": ["Africa", "Featured"], "tags": ["Democratic Republic of Congo", "Repression", "Struggle for land"], "sections": ["Africa", "Featured", "Democratic Republic of Congo", "Repression", "Struggle for land", "English", "pll_6609c0dd67ffb"], "source_name": "Red Herald"}
