<p>On Easter Monday 1916 Irish republicans established the Army of the Irish Republic and proclaimed in arms the Irish Republic. For five days the Republican forces held out against British imperialism and relit the spark of revolution in Ireland.</p>
<p>Every year the Republican Movement, which continues their struggle against imperialism, commemorates these historic days. Anti Imperialist Action Ireland has already reported on some of the commemoration this year.</p>
<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of March there was an commemoration in Bray, County Wicklow, led by Socialist Republican Colour Party.</p>
