<p><strong>Ecevit Piroğlu has started a hunger strike again to protest the unlawful attitude of the Serbian state.</strong></p>
<p>Ecevit Piroğlu, who was arrested in Serbia on June 1, 2022, went on a hunger strike that lasted 136 days last year,due to Turkey’s extradition request, and the extradition decision was stopped with great international solidarity.</p>
<p>Piroğlu, who was released on January 12, 2024, was arrested again by the Serbian immigration police waiting in front of the prison, and taken to another prison-like extradition camp.</p>
<p>Ecevit Piroğlu, who did not accept these unlawful practices, started a hunger strike once again for his freedom. A press conference is being held by the ” <strong>Freedom for Ecevit Piroğlu Initiative</strong>” to condemn the unlawfulness of the Serbian state, to raise revolutionary solidarity with Ecevit Piroğlu, who has been detained in Serbia for 32 months, and make the people conscious of it.</p>
<p>All sensitive groups and the press were invited to the press conference to be held today at 14:00 at the Cologne AVEG-KON office.</p>
<p>Date: Monday , February 19, 2024 Time: 14:00</p>
<p>Address: Homarstraße 64, 51107 Cologne</p>
