He was previously a member of the erstwhile Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) and led large-scale land struggles in the state of Bihar after the death of MCCI leader com. Kanhai Chatterjee. Mishra was in-charge of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir after MCCI merged with CPI ML (People\u2019s War) to form CPI (Maoist) in 2004. Even the American imperialists took note of him during this period and featured him in their Country Reports on Terrorism in 2006. He was arrested by the Indian state in 2008 but was acquitted and released in 2017. He was re-arrested in August 2023. Hem Mishra, a student of Chinese language in Jawaharlal Nehru University, was a popular cultural activist with Revolutionary Cultural Front (RCF) in Delhi. His activism raised awareness of the Indian state\u2019s genocidal war on people in Bastar, particularly against the Adivasi peasants, the imperialist resource loot of India\u2019s natural resources as well as the semi-feudal violence prevalent in Indian society. He was arrested in 2013 under the charges of being a \u201ccourier\u201d for Maoists and remains incarcerated.</p><p></p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8986\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"768\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"../Images/2024-02-19T22-04-29-00-00/000006.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-02-19T22-04-29-00-00/000006.png\" width=\"1024\"/></figure></div><p></p><p>Wall writing in Delhi demanding the release of Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Central Committee member of the CPI (Maoist) and the secretary of the Western Ghats Zonal Committee.
