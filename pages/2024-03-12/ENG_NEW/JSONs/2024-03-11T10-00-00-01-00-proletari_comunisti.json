New forces have emerged and yes \n old forces are strengthened, which represent the extremes of capitalism, \n of exploitation and social, ethnic, religious discrimination, \n cultural and gender. All this ideological and political offensive you are \n carried out parallel to the attack on rights and conquests for decades it was \n necessary for EU imperialist bourgeoisie. It was necessary to put under the \n reflectors the workers and oppressed and give them the blame for the crisis in \n course. These far -right and fascist policies not only do not oppose \n to the EU, but they are \"meat and blood\". This is political perception \n of the capitalist imperialist system that manifests itself when in crisis or in \n danger.</span><span style=\"mso-ansi-language: IT;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;\"><span lang=\"EL\">At the same time, the pandemic crisis e \n The Sars-Covid 19 epidemic, although initially they have created a problem with \n production process and the capitalist system as a whole, they are \n transformed into an opportunity for a further attack through laws \n Anti-Opera and anti-Popolar.</span><span style=\"mso-ansi-language: IT;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;\"><span lang=\"EL\">The myth of \"Europe of peoples\", of \n socio-human face of the European Union now shows its true face.

It is obvious for \n Anyone who wants to see him that a handful of imperialist countries is governing \n The EU. Promote the exploitation of the bourgeoisie against all other peoples \n and the working classes and at the same time squeezes the wealth from</span><span style=\"mso-ansi-language: IT;\">remaining</span><span lang=\"EL\">Employee countries. \n This is the reality of the European Union.

But the truth is that Parliament \n European is a puppet without any significant and decisive function, one \n show set up to deceive the peoples of Europe and to distract them from \n their struggle. It is a \"greenhouse\" in which the lobby of the system grow, in which \n The only thing that the so -called MEP obey are the \"bags of \n money \"available to capitalists to promote their interests \n inside and outside the EU.</span><span style=\"mso-ansi-language: IT;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;\"><span lang=\"EL\">We support the struggles of peoples and workers. \n These are the struggles that the governments of the EU countries are criticizing e \n denigrating. We support the strikes that broke out in France for the law of \n citizens to a pension to live with, the workers' strikes of \n transport in Germany and Spain. We support the struggles of the farmers, such as \n Recently in France and Greece. The continuation and the path to the \n justice for the struggles of workers and peoples does not pass through \n The acceptance of miserable illusions on the European Parliament and the EU. The \n mobilizations of workers are the hope of a better future for \n workers and peoples of Europe.</span><span style=\"mso-ansi-language: IT;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;\"><span lang=\"EL\">The Via dei Popoli is outside the European Parliament \n And against the EU, a way of solidarity and brotherhood.
