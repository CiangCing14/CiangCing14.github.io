During the march, slogans were shouted such as \u2018Hanau was not an individual event, resistance everywhere\u2019 (Hanau War Kein Einzelfall, Widerstand \u00dcbell) and \u2018all together against fascism\u2019 (Alle Zusammen Gegen from Fascchismus).</p><p>In the rally and march, it was emphasized that racism was produced consciously by the sovereigns to divide the working class by the sovereign speakers, and in this respect, the struggle against racism also meant the struggle against the capitalist-imperialist order. The action was terminated by calling for rising institutional racism and calling for meeting and organizing on the streets in the struggle against racism and fascism.</p></div>", "source": "https://www.atik-online.net/blog/hanau-katliaminin-viyanada-protesto-edildi", "type": "article", "title": "HANAU Massacre Protested in Vienna", "description": "Vienna | 21.02.2024 | Hanau massacre, where nine immigrants lost their lives as a result of a racist attack, were four ...", "author": ["muhabirmehmet"], "categories": ["Avrupa", "Haberler", "Manset"], "link-section": "haberler"}
