Many have reportedly been subjected to inhuman and\n degrading treatment, denied menstruation pads, food and medicine, and \nseverely beaten. On at least one occasion, Palestinian women detained in\n Gaza were allegedly kept in a cage in the rain and cold, without food.</p><p>\u201cWe\n are particularly distressed by reports that Palestinian women and girls\n in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual \nassault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army \nofficers. At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly \nraped while others were reportedly threatened with rape and sexual \nviolence,\u201d the experts said. They also noted that photos of female \ndetainees in degrading circumstances were also reportedly taken by the \nIsraeli army and uploaded online.</p><p>The experts expressed concern \nthat an unknown number of Palestinian women and children, including \ngirls, have reportedly gone missing after contact with the Israeli army \nin Gaza. \u201cThere are disturbing reports of at least one female infant \nforcibly transferred by the Israeli army into Israel, and of children \nbeing separated from their parents, whose whereabouts remain unknown,\u201d \nthey said.</p><p>\u201cWe remind the Government of Israel of its obligation \nto uphold the right to life, safety, health, and dignity of Palestinian \nwomen and girls and to ensure that no one is subjected to violence, \ntorture, ill-treatment or degrading treatment, including sexual \nviolence,\u201d the experts said.</p><p>They called for an independent, \nimpartial, prompt, thorough and effective investigation into the \nallegations and for Israel to cooperate with such investigations.</p><p>\u201cTaken\n together, these alleged acts may constitute grave violations of \ninternational human rights and humanitarian law, and amount to serious \ncrimes under international criminal law that could be prosecuted under \nthe Rome Statute,\u201d the experts said. \u201cThose responsible for these \napparent crimes must be held accountable and victims and their families \nare entitled to full redress and justice,\u201d they added.</p><p><em><strong>* The experts: Reem Alsalem,</strong></em><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/sr-violence-against-women\"><em>Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, its causes and consequences</em></a><em>;<strong>Francesca Albanese,</strong></em><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/sr-palestine\" title=\"Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967\"><em>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967</em></a><em>;<strong>Dorothy Estrada Tanck</strong>(Chair)<strong>, Claudia Flores, Ivana Krstic, Hain Lu,</strong>and<strong>Laura Nyirinkindi,</strong></em><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/wg-women-and-girls\" title=\"Working Group on discrimination against women and girls\"><em>Working group on discrimination against women and girls</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>The experts are part of what is known as the</em><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures-human-rights-council\"><em><strong>Special Procedures</strong></em></a><em>of the Human Rights Council.
