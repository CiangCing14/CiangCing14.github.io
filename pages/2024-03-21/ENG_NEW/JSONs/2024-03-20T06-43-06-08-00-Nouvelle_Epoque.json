Despite the attempt by the Presidency of the CAD to have the meeting canceled, it was able to take place, bringing together around thirty people.<br/><br/>The spokesperson of the CFP began by presenting the work of the women of the CFP in the student world in particular, in which the organization works to break down the walls of the university and start the ideological class struggle in the heart of the bastion of the bourgeoisie. The second part of the CFP's work is located in the heart of the proletarian masses, in the working-class neighborhoods, especially in the United States, in which activists fight among the women of the masses, carrying out a relentless work of mobilization, politicization and organization of women within the framework of the CPES.<br/><br/>Following the presentation of the activist, Palestinian women were able to express themselves on the role of women in the Resistance. They strongly recalled and hammered that the enemy was in no way the Palestinian man but indeed imperialism, going against the little-bourgeois conceptions placing in elevation in essence women and men. Indeed, it is imperialism that maintains the old patriarchal structures, which allows the survival of the black misery in which the women of the people live.<br/>They thus wanted to recall that women must bring the weight of two mountains: imperialism and patriarchy, and that in this they have men to gain in the revolutionary struggle for socialism, the only one in Emancipate them.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4077\" data-id=\"4077\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000002.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000002.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4078\" data-id=\"4078\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000003.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000003.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4079\" data-id=\"4079\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000004.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000004.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4080\" data-id=\"4080\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000005.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000005.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4081\" data-id=\"4081\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000006.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000006.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4082\" data-id=\"4082\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000007.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000007.jpeg\"/></figure><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Meeting du CFP le 7 mars</figcaption></figure><p>On March 8, we found a combative and anti-imperialist procession in the heart of the demonstration, organized by the Lyons pit and the popular women's committee. This procession was placed in support of the glorious Palestinian national resistance and in particular the women of Palestine and especially Gaza, who hold their people and their families on their shoulders despite bombardments, blockade and famine. The Palestinian, red flags and those of the Lyons pit brought together, behind a banner \"Support for our Sisters of Gaza which fight against imperialism and patriarchy! Palestine will defeat \"and many slogans and songs in support of armed struggle, women of Palestine and against Israel, Zionism and imperialism have resonated.<br/>Several speeches by activists of the anti-imperialist procession made it possible to largely carry these revolutionary, anti-imperialist watchwords, and for the struggle for the emancipation of women. Beyond the Yankee imperialism and Zionist barbarism, French imperialism has also been attacked for its role in the inhuman treatment of Mahorais women, in order to support that the patriarchy does not stop at the borders of the imperialist powers, But that these are the guards of this oppression of women.<br/><br/>We have noticed that this procession was particularly well received in its path, proof if it is needed that despite the lead of imperialism and its post-modern ideologies, the women of the people dare to fight, and, and, Above all, dare to defeat.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4086\" data-id=\"4086\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000008.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000008.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4084\" data-id=\"4084\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000009.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000009.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4085\" data-id=\"4085\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000010.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000010.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4089\" data-id=\"4089\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000011.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000011.jpeg\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4087\" data-id=\"4087\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000012.jpeg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-20T06-43-06-08-00/000012.jpeg\"/></figure></figure></div></div>", "source": "https://www.nouvelleepoque.fr/lyon-plusieurs-evenements-et-actions-a-loccasion-du-8-mars-journee-internationale-de-lutte-pour-les-droits-des-femmes/", "type": "article", "title": "Lyon: Several events and actions on the occasion of March 8, International Women's Rights Rights Day - New era", "description": "On the occasion of March 8, the Popular Women's Committee (CFP) has largely mobilized in Lyon to bring the revolutionary watchwords high for the struggle for the emancipation of women.
