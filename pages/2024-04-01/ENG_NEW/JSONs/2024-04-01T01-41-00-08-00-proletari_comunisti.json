There is no justice in it, \n no ethical consciousness or justified action; There is only one \n gigantic will to annihilate the Palestinians.</span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>Ferocity, \n  cruelty, terror. Any term is used to describe the \n behavior of the Israeli army, even the most precise, will not be \n never able to fully represent what is happening \n really in Gaza. Which is something exceptional; extraordinary, \n own.</span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>Becomes\n It is becoming increasingly clear that what is happening in that strip of \nEarth is, at the same time, a ferocity<span></span></span></span></span></p><a name=\"more\"></a><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>already seen, which re -tightened to others \n genocidal drives, and a new type ferocity, which stands out for \n the high technological capacity used against a people substantially \n Unarmed. A painful and cowardly ferocity.</span></span></span><p></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>It is\n It is clear that the aim of the Israeli army is not \"the destruction of \nHamas\", but the removal of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, \nFirst stage for a new colonization. It doesn't exist \u2013 nor is it possible, \nGiven the history of that conflict \u2013 no different goal.<span></span></span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>Self \n  It will not be a total departure, it will have to be balanced \n  - fragile - of that area of the world, rather than the ethical awakening of \n Westerners or Arab countries. For the highly symbolic impact it has \n  Always had in the Arab populations, the \"Palestinian question\" is not \n resolvable with a simple physical elimination of the Palestinians; \n someone will have to stay alive, perhaps confined in some desert, \n So that the balances are maintained at a guard level.

All the superstitions arising from the excess of \nfamiliarity with Israeli \"democracy\", from the propensity to \ntolerate their excesses and crimes, they handed over the Palestinians \nto the massacre.</span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>In\n For the past two years, we have become intoxicated with rhetoric, demonizing the \nautocracies and glorifying the liberal-democratic system; but the \nthe pitiful spectacle offered by the West in the face of the genocide of the \ndemonstrates \u2013 once again and unequivocally \u2013 that this \nIt is not \"values\", \"universal\" rights or the law that counts. \nbut only strategic alliances.</span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>The \n  \"Spirit\" profound liberal-democracies is not very different from \n that of autocrazies: You make history when you do business. From \n consequence, any positioning different from the one that brings a \n Strategic advantage is nefarious and must be carefully avoided. Until \n  When Israel will help to defend the western ambitions of \n hegemony, until it is worthy of this role in the chessboard \n medium-eastern, will not discredit its value.</span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>Not \n  It is certain that the greatest mystification has revealed itself \n In the most squalid representatives of militarized liberalism, i \n fanatics of atlantism who did not hesitate to accuse of \n Anti -Semitism anyone who has criticized Israel.

There's the democracy of privilege, and there's that democracy \nfairness. In the first, what has the most value is the market, the \nprofit, business, all dimensions that produce inequalities and \npoverty; in the second, the overcoming of iniquities is at the heart of \nevery action, its sole purpose.</span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>There \n  First, that of privileges is the democracy of the stock exchange, of \n colonialism, the accentralization of wealth in a few hands, of \n combination of politics and military industry; The second is democracy \n of the \"without properties\", of peoples, of peace.</span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>For \n  The first, the theft of resources serves to maintain privileges; and the \n  democracy that wants to export herself, not hesitating to bomb \n other nations, invading lands not of his, violating the law \n international. For the second, only the equality of peoples has value \n positive, any part of the land inhabits.</span></span></span></p><p align=\"left\"><span><span style=\"font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;\"><span>There is\n the democracy of imperial interests, and there is that of the peoples.
