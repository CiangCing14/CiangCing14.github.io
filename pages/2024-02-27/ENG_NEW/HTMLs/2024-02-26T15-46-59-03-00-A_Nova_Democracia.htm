The police wore a white S10 and chevrolet onyx, both with cold plates, and carried rifles.</p><p>When they ordered the distributor's owner to let them enter the establishment, the resident said she would only do so with the arrival of her lawyer. The police, who had no court order for the operation, pulled the grid of the residence, handcuffed the resident and began an illegal magazine. During the search, they also beaten the owner of the establishment with punches, slaps and players.</p><p>"Even saying that I would only open the door in the presence of my lawyer, they invaded the house, assaulted me with slaps, punches and played in my head, wanting to know where my boyfriend was," she said at the time.</p><p>Before leaving and taking the victim to the police station, the military would also have erased the security camera circuit of the establishment.</p><p>The justification for the barbarity of the military was the "search for drugs and weapons." Nothing was found during the invasion. Of the military involved, a cable and a warrant officer, two were arrested after a stretch of a security camera that was recovered by the victim's family.</p></div>
