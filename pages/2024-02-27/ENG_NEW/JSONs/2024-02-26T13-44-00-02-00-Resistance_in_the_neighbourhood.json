Students with occupations and demonstrations are struggling to prevent the bill on private universities, which aims to abolish the right to free studies and the stroke of democratic freedoms in the field of study.</p><p>The working class, workers are experiencing unbearable conditions at work and their daily lives, at the same time trying to get the month with salaries that reach only for the first few days, while accuracy is galloping. The government invites us to accept poverty and poverty, since their economy cannot stand, at the same time as it treasures the capital and spends 3.5% of GDP on military spending, dozens of billions on F-35s and other equipment programs .</p><p></p><p>The so -called growth played by the ND government requires no rights work, up to the deep old age, intensification and inhumane working conditions with consumable workers who will be sacrificed on the altar of capital profitability. That is why it promotes one anti -populist bill after another and hits that it is left of free care (afternoon payrolls with payment and new \"NSS\"). in universities with repression forces to hit student occupations.</p><p>The peasantry's peasants in the country, but also in the rest of Europe, the movement of student youth, solidarity demonstrations in Palestinian resistance around the world, send a message of hope that workers, peoples want to live life with rights. Despite slander and state repression they insist on fighting for their right.</p><p>These struggles have not only the government and the parties of the system (PASOK, SYRIZA, fascist structures) that support its policy but also the sold -out GSEE leadership that has not only rejected any struggle against government policy but are stable System pillar. The responsibilities of the reformists are also huge, because at the same time they are talking about racing, their unions have dissolved their policy, and their great anxiety is not how these struggles will be united in a front against anti -populist politics, but How will they be redeemed in the polls of the upcoming European elections.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>THE MASSIC PARTICULAR RACE THE ONLY A REAL DISCUSSION!</b></p><p>To strike and demonstrate with one voice by working students and farmers!
