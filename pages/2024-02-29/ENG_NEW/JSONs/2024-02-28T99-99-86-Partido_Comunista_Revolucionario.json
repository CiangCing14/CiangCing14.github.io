The man was difficult. Friend of Otto Vargas, friend of the Clan Stivel. Things that perhaps at the time we would not have told, so many years spent that we can bleach some of their relationships and some of his tasks such as the link with personalities such as Federico Luppi, Carlos Carella, Marilina Ross. Their poachers in the middle of lead in the cars in motion while exchanging their \"figurines\" and arguing politics being that they were their friends. Friend of David Vi\u00f1as \u201d.</p><p>Ariel Oliveri remembered, son of Nestor, the remembered \"Chinese Doctor\", on his Facebook page: \"Roque militated his whole life and never had a handle. He never had a car. He died in a two -room department that he rented by two mangoes with his retirement. It was one of those guys who do not get into politics to save themselves. He fought all his life to leave a more fair world ...</p><p>\u201cHe was one of the creators and ideologues of Buenos Aires youth tournaments. He told me the whole process and worked with him for many years. He gave me a huge hand. The discussion he put was how many games the kid or the neighborhood piba played that did not come to go around. If there were less than four, it was not a social sport. Always thinking about the massive. \u201d</p><p>And Ram\u00edrez culminated, in the tribute: \u201cRoque lived with absolute fidelity to his ideas, leaves a million friends and a toothbrush. A frugal, austere man.</p><p>\u201cDear companion Jorge Risi, dear Roque until victory always!
