<h2>PDF Content:</h2><hr/><p>Proletarians of all countries, unite!<br>COMRADE LENIN, LEADING LIGHT OF THE INTERNATIONAL<br>PROLETARIAT AND GREAT TEACHER  OF MARXISM-LENINISM-MAOISM,<br>ILLUMINATES THE PATH OF UNITY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL<br>COMMUNIST MOVEMENT<br>"We  are  those  who  form  the  army  of  the  great  proletarian  strategist,  the  army  of<br>Comrade Lenin. There is nothing higher than the honour of belonging to this army. "<br>(Stalin)<br>As the pages of History show, on the 21st of January 1924, Comrade Lenin, the great leader of<br>the working class and oppressed peoples of the world, the second great milestone of M arxism-<br>Leninism-Maoism, became immortal and left behind a great legacy of incalculable value. The<br>teachings of Comrade Lenin, who transformed the "world of the future", the foundations of<br>which were laid by Marx and Engels, from an abstract possibility into a concrete reality, are<br>still fully relevant after a century and great upheavals in the world. In order to position oneself<br>correctly in the class struggle, one must accept this "actuality" and orient oneself to it. This<br>"actuality"  is  at  the  same  time  a  cure  against  reformist,  revisionist  and  parliamentary<br>cretinism, which means capitulation and compromise with ruling ideologies of any kind. It is<br>the guarantee of faith and determination that a communist world can be created.<br>LENIN AS THE TEACHER OF COMMUNISM WHO BROKE THE ICE AND PAVED THE WAY<br>AGAINST INTERNATIONAL REACTION AND REVISIONISM<br><br><br><br>To  correctly  identify  the  contradictions  in  the  history  of  the  class  struggle,  to  grasp  the<br>moments of historical rupture and to be ready in these moments of rupture was the most<br>outstanding feature of comrade Lenin's entire struggle up to his immortality. After the death of<br>Marx and Engels, the leadership of the international proletariat was for a long time taken over<br>by the opportunism of the Second International, and in the words of comrade Stalin: "A period<br>in  which  the  parties  of  the  Second  International  were  not  able  to  take  over  the<br>theoretical struggle to liberate the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples of<br>the  world  from  the  influence  of  these  opportunist  and  class-compromising  social-<br>democrats. In addition to the theoretical struggle for the liberation of the international<br>proletariat  and  the  oppressed  peoples  of  the  world,  with  the  foundation  of  the<br>Communist International he developed a form of organization and struggle appropriate<br>to the dynamics of the class struggle in the new period of capitalism. "<br>Comrade Lenin transformed the Communist Party and the Communist International into an<br>instrument  of  war  against  the  bourgeoisie  by  liberating  the  Communist  Party  and  the<br>movement  of  the  Communist  International  from  the  shackles  of  legal  forms  of  struggle :<br>"Instead of a revolutionary policy, there was flabby philistinism and  sordid political<br>bargaining,  parliamentary  diplomacy  and  parliamentary  scheming.  For  the  sake  of<br>appearances,  of  course,  “revolutionary”  resolutions  and  slogans  were  adopted..."  but<br>which it "keeps in the drawers  of offices",  freed  from the grip  of legal forms  of  struggle.<br>“Meanwhile,  a  new  period  of  imperialist  wars  and  of  revolutionary  battles  of  the<br>proletariat  was  approaching.  The  old  methods  of  fighting  were  proving  obviously<br>inadequate  and  impotent  in  face  of  the  omnipotence  of  finance  capital.  It  became<br>necessary to overhaul the entire activity of the Second International, its entire method of<br>work, and to drive out all philistinism, narrow-mindedness, politicians’ tricks, renegacy,<br>social-chauvinism and social-pacifism. It became necessary to examine the entire arsenal<br>of the Second International, to throw out all that was rusty and antiquated, to forge new<br>weapons. Without  this preliminary work it was useless embarking  upon war  against<br>capitalism. Without this work the proletariat ran the risk of finding itself inadequately<br>armed, or even completely unarmed, in the future revolutionary battles. The honour of<br>bringing about this general overhauling and general cleansing of the Augean stables of<br>the Second International fell to Leninism.”. (Stalin, Foundations of Leninism)<br>Comrade Lenin, with his genius, grasped the core of the contradiction and realized that the<br>struggle against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking<br>off  the  burdens  that  weigh  on  the  back  of  the  international  proletariat,  without  fighting<br>revisionism and opportunism, without showing the masses the true character of these views in<br>theory and practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By establishing the dialectical<br>and necessary link between the "internal struggle" and the "external struggle", he waged the<br>double struggle.<br><br><br>Comrade Lenin left us communists the extremely important lesson that the struggle against<br>revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the struggle against imperialism and<br>all forms of ruling reaction. On the contrary, the struggle against imperialism must be purged<br>of revisionism and opportunism.<br>HOLD HIGH THE TEACHINGS OF LENIN WITHIN THE SHARPENING CONTRADICTIONS<br>OF THE IMPERIALIST SYSTEM<br>The imperialist system, which comrade Lenin analyzed in detail at the beginning of the 20th<br>century, has survived in the past period, but its contradictions are sharpening and it is in a<br>spiral of insoluble antagonist contradictions. Although the dissolution of the USSR and the<br>process  of  integration  into  the  capitalist  system  that  China  went  through  prevented  the<br>contradictions  from  exploding for a while,  the law of  unequal development of  capitalism<br>continued  and  the inter-imperialist rivalry developed  to  the stage of  "disintegration" with<br>regional wars. This shows the crisis the system is in and that the previous "solutions" no longer<br>work. The imperialists, who for a long time maintained their crisis by shifting the burdens of<br>the system to the semi-colonies and deepening the plundering of the semi-colonies, have also<br>reached a dead end here.<br>One of the explosive points of the  inherent  problems of the imperialist system, which have<br>developed in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism, is that the inter-imperialist<br>struggle, which has manifested itself in various forms in recent years, is currently being fought<br>out  in  regional  wars.  When  Lenin  enumerated  the  contradictions  of  imperialism,  he<br>mentioned  the  inter-imperialist  contradiction  as  one  of  the  three  most  important<br>contradictions. <br>We can see that developments are in line with comrade Lenin's observations on the character<br>and contradictions of imperialism:  "The second contradiction is the contradiction among<br>the various financial groups and imperialist Powers in their struggle for sources of raw<br>materials, for foreign territory. Imperialism is the export of capital to the sources of raw<br>materials, the frenzied struggle for monopolist possession of these sources, the struggle<br>for a re-division of the already divided world, a struggle waged with particular fury by<br>new financial groups and Powers seeking a “place in the sun” against the old groups and<br>Powers, which cling tenaciously to what they have seized. This frenzied struggle among<br>the various groups of capitalists is notable in that it includes as an inevitable element<br>imperialist wars, wars for the annexation of foreign territories. This circumstance, in its<br>turn,  is  notable  in  that  it  leads  to  the  mutual  weakening  of  the  imperialists,  to  the<br>weakening of the position of capitalism in general, to the acceleration of the advent of<br>the  proletarian  revolution  and  to  the  practical  necessity  of  this  revolution."  (Stalin,<br>Foundations  of Leninism).<br><br><br>Russia  and  China,  the former socialist countries  that have given the imperialist system a<br>respite with their new markets, have become the main players in the inter-imperialist rivalry,<br>in contention with the hegemonic power United States. This means that the extent and nature<br>of  the contradictions  have increased  with the growing involvement of  new and  powerful<br>players in the struggle for the redistribution of territories. The big confrontation with the<br>invasion  of  Russian  imperialism  in  Ukraine  took  place  against  this  background.  It  is<br>foreseeable that this tendency will deepen and spread further. As long as there is no direct<br>confrontation between the imperialists, the areas where the wars of division are waged are<br>semi-colonies  and  colonies.  The  semi-colonies  and  oppressed  peoples  of  the  world  will<br>continue to pay the price of these wars until the imperialists declare direct war on each other.<br>With this the division of world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed<br>countries  –  masterfully  analyzed  by  Lenin-   deepen  even  more.  The  third  contradictions<br>sharpens with the imperialist pillage and plunder , and the semi-colonial and semi-feudal rise<br>in powerful Wars of National Liberation  and People’s Wars that shake the imperialist system.<br>In  parallel  to  the  process  in  which  imperialism  is  going  under   the  inter-imperialist<br>contradictions,   and  the  contradiction  imperialist  countries  and  oppressed  people’s  and<br>nations; all parts of the ruling system, especially the imperialist states, are becoming more<br>centralized, militaristic and warlike than before, paving the way for all fascist  sentiments to<br>bring society into a corresponding ideological format. This is fulfilled either by  so called right-<br>wing extremist or under the veil of social democratic or liberals parties.  The communists and<br>the oppressed peoples of the world, faced with the reality of a system that is becoming more<br>reactionary and aggressive by the day, need a Leninist Party to lead the proletariat's struggle<br>for political power , as outlined by comrade Lenin, in order to  organize a strong resistance<br>against this  reaction. Only such a  Party,  today a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist one,  can lead an<br>irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeoisie.<br>LENIN'S GREAT LEGACY, THE LENINIST CONCEPTION OF THE PARTY: THE  GENERAL<br>STAFF OF THE PROLETARIAT  <br>A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing<br>embroidery;  it  cannot  be  so  refined,  so  leisurely  and  gentle,  so  temperate,  kind,<br>courteous,  restrained  and  magnanimous.  A  revolution  is  an  insurrection,  an  act  of<br>violence by which one class overthrows another .  (Mao Zedong).<br>It is crucial how the communists define the existing contradictions and how they position<br>themselves in the face of developments. In the hundred years since the death of comrade<br>Lenin,  the  imperialists  have  transformed  their  ruling  structures  into  even  bigger  war<br>machines.  Their  armies,  police,  secret  services  etc.  are  equipped  with  capabilities<br>incomparable to those of the past. On the other hand, a considerable part of those who call<br>themselves  "communists"  or  "revolutionaries"  ignore  this  reality  (even  if  it  seems  to  be<br><br><br>theoretically  accepted)  and  are  far  from  positioning  themselves  in  accordance  with  it.<br>However , by following an ideological and practical line of reconciliation that locks the working<br>class and the oppressed masses into the ruling system, they dampen the anger of the masses<br>and act as breakwaters. While the imperialists and the ruling structures of exploitation are<br>equipping themselves with ever more violent apparatuses and institutions, it is necessary, as<br>followers of comrade Lenin, to wage a strong ideological struggle against the fact that those<br>who define themselves as "revolutionaries" and "communists" are moving further and further<br>away from the reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on arms<br>and  violence.  Taking  comrade  Lenin's  relentless  struggle  against  the  opportunism  of  the<br>Second International as a guide against these views is one of the important tasks to do justice<br>to comrade Lenin in the centenary year of his immortality.<br>Comrade Lenin defined the new type of Communist Party as "the war organization of the<br>proletariat". This definition was necessitated due to the imperialist system and the mutual<br>position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October Revolution and the civil war<br>that broke out with the October Revolution were the concrete reasons of why comrade Lenin<br>called the communist party the "war organization of the proletariat". It is a necessity that the<br>Communist  Party,  which  will  lead  the  emancipation  of  the  proletariat  and  the  oppressed<br>masses, should have this characteristic, while the counterrevolution is arming itself from top<br>to  bottom with the apparatus  and  means  of  violence and  is  committing all these terrible<br>massacres against the working class and the oppressed peoples. A revolutionary war needs a<br>fighting Party to wage it. Only fools and incorrigible revisionists who rely on the bourgeoisie<br>can see it otherwise.<br>Some people ridicule us as advocates of the “omnipotence of war”. Yes, we are advocates<br>of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist. The guns of<br>the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We shall create a democratic republic.<br>Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the<br>power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed<br>bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole<br>world be transformed.  (Mao Zedong).<br>At its founding conference, the ICL defined the building and reconstitution of  Communist<br>Parties  as  an  important  task  in  the  struggle  for  world  proletarian  revolution.  The<br>understanding of the Communist Party developed by Comrade Mao Zedong is in line with the<br>understanding of  the Communist Party outlined  by Comrade Lenin,  and  also  enriched  by<br>Stalin, and is the realization of the Leninist understanding of the Party in the ideology of<br>Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. In the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions in which<br>we find ourselves, the communist party that is capable of opposing the growing aggression of<br>imperialist reaction and leading the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world to<br>liberation must have the quality of a "war organization of the proletariat". <br><br><br>An essential legacy of Lenin is the question of political power as the fundamental question of<br>every revolution. Lenin showed how "The proletarian revolution is impossible without the<br>violent destruction of the bourgeois state machinery and without its replacement by a<br>new one" and how  “all but power is an illusion ”.  Under Lenin's personal leadership, the<br>world's first socialist State, the dictatorship of the proletariat was established, concreting the<br>proletarian path to power and to maintain it. <br>After Lenin's death, it was his continuator Stalin who brilliantly defined Leninism, developed it<br>further and made it the basis of the entire International Communist Movement. Based on the<br>shoulders  of  the  great  Lenin,  Chairman  Mao  was  able  to  advance  the  World  Proletarian<br>Revolution to greater heights and to develop the  ideology  of the proletariat. Leninism that is<br>today Marxism-Leninism-Maoism  must be embraced, defended and applied today. <br>As the ICL, we will continue to carry out the tasks raised by the great Lenin  and make good use<br>of the legacy left to us by Comrade Lenin.<br>Comrade  Lenin,  the  great  teacher of  the  international  proletariat  and  M arxism-Leninism-<br>Maoism leads and guides our struggle for the world proletarian revolution today as he did<br>yesterday!<br>LONG LIVE MARXISM-LENINISM-MAOISM!<br>LONG LIVE PROLETARIAN INTERNATIONALISM!<br>International Communist League<br>January 2024</p>
