They were joined by members of the \u201cHandi Social Ascenseurs\u201d group, which demands the rehabilitation of elevators in working-class neighborhoods and improved accessibility in general.</p><p>A re-contextualizing speech on the situation was given by a member of the CPES, a speech applauded by those present. At the same time, Ga\u00ebtan Cognard, the \u201cneighborhood mayor\u201d (in reality, one of the service of Jean-Luc Moudenc, the mayor of Toulouse) wanted to organize a meeting with \u201cthe residents\u201d of the R\u00e9sidence du Lac, in a community room on the edge of Lake Reynerie. In reality, it was just going to be a quiet discussion between owners and residents on security issues which would allow the real problems to be put aside (this building was also affected by heating problems).</p><p></p><figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8818\" data-id=\"8818\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"769\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"../Images/2024-02-15T20-36-09-00-00/000001.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-02-15T20-36-09-00-00/000001.png\" width=\"1024\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8836\" data-id=\"8836\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"769\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"../Images/2024-02-15T20-36-09-00-00/000002.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-02-15T20-36-09-00-00/000002.png\" width=\"1024\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8819\" data-id=\"8819\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" src=\"../Images/2024-02-15T20-36-09-00-00/000003.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-02-15T20-36-09-00-00/000003.png\" width=\"768\"/></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8820\" data-id=\"8820\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px\" src=\"../Images/2024-02-15T20-36-09-00-00/000004.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-02-15T20-36-09-00-00/000004.png\" width=\"771\"/></figure><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">A spokesperson for the CPES first denounced the living conditions and the anti-people political maneuvers in a widely applauded speech.

Such contempt!</p><p>For around thirty minutes, the mobilized residents tried to obtain a position from him on the heating problems but also on the questions of elevators and the demolitions of buildings. Like a good opportunist, he chattered without taking a position, saying that he was going to organize a \u201cdiscussion\u201d. Unfortunately for him, people don\u2019t want words but actions. He was also asked several times what he had put in place since his years in management to counter recurring heating problems, to which he was unable to answer.</p><p>In the end, the residents did not have an answer to their questions and demands, and decided to leave the place with determination, deciding to move up a gear. They promised the elected Macronist that there would be more and more of them, before leaving with their heads held high.
