It is the youth of the neighborhoods, revolted in June, in 2018 after Th\u00e9o's rape, in 2005 after the assassination of Zyed and Bouna, in the 1980s in V\u00e9nissieux, which is attacked, because it is the base and the engine of the proletarian revolution in France.<br/><br/>The State and its armed force have understood this well: it is necessary to crush this youth, whether in school, by parents, humiliated for years, by insufficient allowances and wages, which allow to try to make To believe that those who produce everything are in fact \u201cparasites\u201d, and in the blood if necessary. It is necessary to destroy by the armed and judicial repression the desires of changes: that is to say, of revolution.<br/><br/>But the proletarian youth will no longer be done. The memory of Nahel is still hot, many rebels still imprisoned, and yet young people did not hesitate to revolt, clashes broke out at La Courneuve on the night of Sunday to Monday, the police station being taken by storm and Targeted by jets of Molotov cocktails, the police taking several hours before regaining control of the situation. Six arrests are to be deplored in these clashes, which will be doubted, to no doubt, to new prison terms.<br/><br/>Over 50 years ago, the Journal de la Gauche proletarienne, headlined: \"Force should no longer be the law\". It has never been so fair, and it will remain so as long as the capitalist system has not been destroyed, it will never be the law in capitalist society again. In France, in Palestine, or even in Brazil, youth revolts, makes the old world tremble, and proves to the immense mass of the people, to the whole proletariat, to what extent the system that dominates us, imperialism, is weak: a \u201cpaper tiger\u201d, as President Mao said.</p></div></div>", "source": "https://www.nouvelleepoque.fr/la-courneuve-idf-un-assassinat-policier-de-plus/", "type": "article", "title": "La Courneuve (IDF): one more police assassination - new era", "description": "\u200c9 months after the assassination of Nahel who had ignited France in June 2023, a new young person died in vague circumstances this Wednesday, March 13 at La Courneuve (Seine Saint-Denis), the young Wanys, 18.
