Perla was a woman in the fight, despite her serious health problems (fought lupus), was present in this fight for housing since the beginning, in 2020, when she raised her small canvas shack. Perla has always been present in the school activities, participating in training courses, ensuring the organization and preservation of the school and also showing interest in teaching reinforcement classes for children.</p><p>Last January, the partner Perla passed away after contracted Covid, a picture that complicated her health problem already affected by Lupus. Mother of 4 children, Perla left her small shack, who over these years, with a lot of effort, turned into a masonry house, but, more than that, left the example for so many other women who are in the fight for the fight for home.
