Last year, Helse Nord ended with a deficit of NOK 407 million. Figures that were presented by Director Geir Toll\u00e5li on Thursday show that Helse Nord was NOK 45 million on deficit in February this year.</p><p>The deficit is greatest at the University Hospital Northern Norway (UNN), where they already so far this year have expenses related to a breach of 26 million.</p><p>- We had thought that the measures [hospitals] have outlined and planned to embark on would produce better results than what we see the current year. Unfortunately, the financial situation is very demanding in all health enterprises, says CEO Marit Lind to NRK.</p><p>NRK claims that much of Helse Nord's \"expenses\" is due to the use of temporary workers. Proposals for \"budget solutions\" are therefore to cut in a temporary agency where possible, and at the same time also cut in permanent personnel in areas where there are \"for many\".</p><p><strong>References</strong>:<br/><a href=\"https://www.nrk.no/tromsogfinnmark/styremote-i-helse-nord-i-mars_-stort-underskot-allereie-i-februar-1.16814672\">Two months into the year were the speech bloodraude: - highly demanding</a>(nrk.no)</p></section>", "source": "https://tjen-folket.no/2024/03/24/helse-nord-ma-kutte-1-milliard-kroner/", "type": "article", "title": "Health Nord must cut 1 billion kroner", "description": "Helse Nord is in financial squeeze and will have to make big cuts in the budget over the next few years.", "modified time": "2024-03-24T06:14:20+00:00", "author": ["Tjen Folket Media"], "categories": ["Innenriks"], "source_name": "Tjen Folket"}
