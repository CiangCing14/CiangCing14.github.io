In the midst of the fair fight of \n  Student masses against private universities and law-lack \n  Pierrakaki, discussed the \"opening\" of the PH in the \"world environment \n Education \"and\" Expanding the Cooperation capabilities of PH with \n American universities, research institutes. \"<p></p><div class=\"entry-content\"><p>Of course, behind these lines we know very well what they have in \n their minds the Americans and their local minions, which are no more \n  by the dependent Greek bourgeoisie. With these words do not \n prepare anything other than the depths of the country's dependency, the \n Further sale - economic and political - to imperialists and \n Chronic pursuit of harmonizing education in American \n \"standards\". Especially after the Pierrakakis law is passed, they plow the \n ground for the establishment of foreign university branches in Greece, such as \n  The establishment of the announced private medical school in Athens by \n  American fund holding 6 private clinics in the country and the \n Sold 10% of PPC. They want to intensify the 'brain drain' phenomenon \n transferring workers' potential from interior abroad, where \n  They will staff the great imperialist metropolises.</p><p>The peoples of the peoples and their embassy - which at the moment \n bloodshed Ukraine and Palestine, who have made the \n Thessaly and Greece in general a vast death base with the \n Their American bases - they don't stop there! Years now they want \n to intervene and exploit the education of the country (see \n Letter from the US Embassy to the Ministry of Education in 2009). Their \n annoys that students here still study free and still have \n Rights that the student movement won with its struggle! \n They constantly hit public-dimensional education, they want to get tuition, \n Deletions and Limits of study, want dissolved diplomas, one education for \n Few and chosen, a university without student associations, \n Games and free progressive views. It is known that the \n Pierrakaki bills were promoted to cover these \n Aspirations of the foreign \"prostate\" of the domestic bourgeoisie!</p><p>And in the midst of it all, they want higher education at the service of \narmaments. The construction of a military drone by schools of the University of Thessaloniki\n in collaboration with the Hellenic Air Force, it is recent! \nThey prepare to develop further war research and give \nClear message that the urban university will only work for \ntheir interests and the service of the sharpened inter-imperialists \ntheir controversies. And the Administration of UTH \"first and best\" opens \nthe way to the murderers of the peoples to achieve the most bloodthirsty plans\n their!</p><p>We have nothing to expect anything good from this system \n exploitation and oppression, taking part in the mackene \n whole peoples. To oppose this black reality. To \n We resist the depth of the country's dependency. Along with the people and the \n  labor, to build anti-war-anti-imperialist front, which \n will put a brake on their war operations and its involvement \n our country on the war fronts, which are constantly open against peoples \n of the world!</p><p>Not let the imperialists take command in studies \n us. To defend public-free education. To continue the \n Our struggle for the overthrow of Pierrakakis Law. Against \n reformist left (MSc-EAKA), which puts a brake on the occupations, the \n Assemblies and in the mobilizations in general, trapped in \n deadlocked logic \"not to apply the voted law\", which leads the \n Struggling student masses in frustration and submission to \n Urban legitimacy of the system.</p><p>We make our schools resistance! We continue with \n Assemblies-Services-Divisions until we throw the voted law \n For private universities!</p><ul><li><b>UNWANTABLE ARE THE MURDERERS OF THE PEOPLES</b></li><li><b>NO to US-NATO-EU dependence</b></li><li><b>PARTY FOR THE RECEIVING OF PIERRAKAKI LAW</b></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b></b></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b></b></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b></b></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><img alt=\"\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-16T12-06-00-08-00/000001.png\" style=\"height: 500px; width: 281.109px;\"/></b></p></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://agonistikeskiniseis.org/sunantisi-presveias-amerikanon-me-to-panepistimio-thessalias/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>RACE MOVEMENTS</b></span></a></div><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div>", "description": "", "author": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2!"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b5\u03b9-\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9", "\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b9\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2", "\u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7", "\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_82.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
