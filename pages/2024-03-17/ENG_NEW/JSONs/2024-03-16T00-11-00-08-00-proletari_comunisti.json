It is a \n provision given by the commissioner, with very large discretion, which he has \n Immediate and upsetting effects on the legal and personal sphere. \n For these reasons, careful investigation would be foreseen on \n elements that justify its adoption. Investigation which, according to the \n Turin judges, in this case it would have been missing.</p><p>The order also focuses on the merits of the provision. THE \n Giudici underline how \u201cthe danger is feared in terms \n completely abstract \"and as\" the democratic - constitutional system \n tolerates purely demonstrative manifestations, to be ascribed to the \n manifestation of thought where they did not lead to the risk of \n damage to people or things \". In short, these are not dangerous criminals, \n  but simple citizens who, although in a very showy way, exercise \n  one's right to demonstrate.</p><p>A right that, in the case of climatic activists, is more and more \n Often questioned, also in the Democratic Europe.
