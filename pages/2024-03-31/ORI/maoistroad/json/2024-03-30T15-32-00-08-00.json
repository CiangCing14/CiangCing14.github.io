It undertook a limited amount of work \ndirectly for Lockheed Martin, but most of its JSF work was through BAE \nSystems plc, including the manufacture of fixtures and composite tooling\n for the vertical tail. Broens also won an international multi-million \ndollar tender by Pratt &amp; Whitney to design and manufacture the \nengine gearbox lift. In 2012, Broens was reported as manufacturing \nmultiple units of the lift. It was expected that ultimately every JSF \nsquadron globally would have one or more; an estimated global total of \n150 lifts.
