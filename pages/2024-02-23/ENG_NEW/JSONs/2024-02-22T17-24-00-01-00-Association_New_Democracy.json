In grazing lands, for example, if \n We divide the total number of animals into large farms by the total \n hectares of pastures, the large farms in Brazil have only 0.65 animals per \n hectare of grazing land, while in Peru it is incredibly low, \n 0.06 animals per hectare (IBGE 2012; INEI 2012). This means that these \n landowners averages much less than one animal for each hectare of land \n grazing, while small properties can have between 2 and 10 \n animals per hectare. In Peru, small farms of less than \n fifty hectares average 12 animals per hectare of grazing land, \n approximately two hundred times more than the great properties of the country (INEI \n 2012).</span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><span></span></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span><u>In addition, much of the land dedicated to grazing and \n forests is totally unrelated, which means that the owners have \n inverted little or nothing on earth and simply harvest it for their products \n natural and seminatural</u>. In the big stays of Brazil, 33 percent \n of all grazing lands are not improved, while in Peru almost \n 95 percent is not improved (IBGE 2012; INEI 2012). This means no \n There has been no investment in things like planted or irrigated pastures, new \n varieties of pastures or fertilizers that can increase the productivity of \n the grazing lands.

Table 2 \n shows the percentage of large properties in Brazil and Peru that use \n various methods and technologies associated with modern agriculture.

Without \n However, detailed information about appropriation can rarely be found \n of land in the data of the agricultural census, so I turn to the \n Secondary literature in search of evidence of this. \u201d</span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span><o:p></o:p>The long interpolation that belongs \n to<b>:</b><b><span style='font-family: Helvetica, \"sans-serif\";'>Agrarian Structure and Underdevelopment in Latin America:\nBringing the Latifundio \u201cBack In\u201d,</span></b><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/search?filters%5BauthorTerms%5D=Chris%20Carlson&amp;eventCode=SE-AU\"><span><span data-v-63dfaf6e=\"\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit;\">Chris Carlson</span></span></a>,<span>Published\nonline by Cambridge University Press:<strong data-v-862424e6=\"\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;\"><span style=\"border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm;\">02 January 2022</span></strong></span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><span></span></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>2.<span><b>Importance of the subject and some news of agricultural movements in the related EU</b></span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><span></span></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>It was already said at the end of the 19th century, and retains its \n News, that:</span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><span></span></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"></span>It is a phenomenon \n curious the fact that agriculture gains political importance in the same \n extent to which it loses economic importance in relation to the industry.</span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><span></span></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"></span>It is apparent \n contradiction between economic importance and political importance, \n Explain if we remember that, everywhere, the private property of the Earth \n has entered into contradiction with the</span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>existing mode of production long before property \n deprived of the other means of production and engendra much faster \n An unsustainable and unbearable situation.</span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><span></span></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"></span>It is not surprising that \n agricultural issues occupy so vividly in civilized states to \n men who direct political life.
