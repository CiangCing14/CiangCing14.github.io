Along with them, former police officer Germano da Luz Junior was also arrested.</p><p>The blatant came when, on March 24, the agents broke into the neighborhood of the current, in the municipality of Manacapuru, and kidnapped a man and a woman. The relatives of the victims then went to look at them at the police station, since the men presented themselves as police, and, with no record there, began a complaint that led to the arrest of the paramilitarians.</p><p>According to the ongoing investigations, the common practice of the agents was to kidnap and torture people involved with drug trafficking so that they could intercept the narcotics and thus sell them to other groups.</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paramilitaries kept an arsenal available</h4><p>Next to the paramilitarists were seized 22 porters, plus 17 firearms (some, with scraped numbering) and 207 varied ammunition. Nine mobile phones, three falsified cars, three vest covers, two ballistic vests, three holloves, balaclavas and handcuffs were also found.</p><p>The robustness of tampered equipment, as well as the discharge in the involvement of civil and military agents gives us an idea of how so organized are becoming the paramilitary groups formed by police in the state of Amazonas.</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The number of cases of paramilitary involvement with repressive forces of the state grows</h4><p>In addition to the growing scandals involving police brutality, cases of torture or summary executions that have been increasing among operations and patrols, there is also a growing in the event of organization of police groups and former police for paramilitary functions in the region.</p><p>Only in the year 2023 is this the third case of involvement of these groups with drug trafficking.
