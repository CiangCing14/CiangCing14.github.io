There was a rupture of the nervous \nsystem that connects the shoulder to the brain because of the \nill-treatment by the police when they kidnapped and arrested me. This\n It hurt my shoulder. I can't lift my left hand. I can't\n to do nothing with it. I can't keep a book.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Because of\n of destruction of the nervous system, muscles were also affected \nof the shoulder. Because of pulling and trauma, my left ribs\n They were crowded and crushed. These hit the lungs. With the \nTheir turn, these affected my heart, and hit the left side \nher. But my backbone was also affected, because the ribs \nThey were crushed in a small spot.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">All\n This side of my body has been affected. In the last 10 years, \nI feel severe pain in my left arm and leg. Because of its destruction \nnervous system and muscles, my left shoulder is paralyzed \ncompletely.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Because of \n  The effect on my left lung, sleep apnea began. From the \n Nose to the lungs, the path of breathing was affected. This \n caused a obstructive sleep apnea. Because of this, I can't \n sleep.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">I have \n  suffer a state of the heart called hypertrophic \n Cardiomyopathy, which had not been detected in any medicine \n exam before I throw in prison. As a result of this, the left side \n The heart works only with 55% of its ability. Began and \n high blood pressure because the heart wall could not \n push the blood quite a bit into my body.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">That's all \n  In ten years, I developed a bladder in the brain. It is not much \n serious, at present, however, could be done at any time \n malignant.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Found\n Also, kidney stones due to limited life and difficulties \nmovement without the possibility of exercise or any physical \nactivity in prison. Although the stones were crushed, cysts \nformed in the right kidney.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">I still developed bile stones due to a lack of feeding for long periods. This led to pancreatitis.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">THE \n  list is endless. All of these diseases were developed in prison. \n Until I went out there was no proper medical care these ten \n years. Therefore, I suffer from multiple diseases.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">He needs \n  Now to have this medical care. It all depends on how now, \n  After such a period of time, I will be able to run, and how many instruments \n  will remain affected and will be able to be carried out. This will \n See.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">The \n  Next days, I will be in hospitals for exams and treatments. \n We do not know how much it will get and to what extent I will recover.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\"><b>Why \n  You were not able to access proper medical care \n in prison; Why were you not given a guarantee suspension, for medical \n reasons;</b></span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">THE \n  This suspension was rejected twice by the Supreme Court. However, \n had been written in the decision to reject the suspension that I should have \n Regular and appropriate medical care.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Nevertheless, \n  Prison authorities ignored and violated the decision. Although with \n They sent to Nagpour Medical School several times, it was about \n Something typical and rough. I was just going and returning. With this, \n They showed that they were trying to provide me with treatment, but there was no \n treatment.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">If \n  See my medical history, you will see how medical care \n It was avoided and not provided. In the end, just before I release, every \n section wrote that [this treatment or medicine] are not available, not \n We can do this, it's available elsewhere. Why doctors wrote \n Only at the end of the ten years that they couldn't heal me? I will \n They had to report it ten years ago.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Not \n  they did anything but to give me painkillers and put me \n sleep. If the treatment was not available to them at the beginning of ten \n years, they had to have written it and ask to be transferred to \n A suitable hospital available.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\"><b>Which one \n  Were the biggest challenges you encountered in prison? How do you \n Did prison staff behave and detainees?</b></span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">The detainees were very helpful. They were very kind. They wanted to be with me all the time, even though I was in a 'Ada' cell<i>(p.</i><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>parapoda</i></span><i>: \n  Cell in the highest safety wing, in oval form within the rest \n Prison, no light, with minimal ventilation and small space for movement.)</i>, where very few - fewer than 10 - could have contact with me when I was not locked in the cell.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">THE \n  Picture that prison authorities and state mechanism were trying \n to give it was that I was somebody's notorious terrorist - a \n \"Brain\" of international Maoism. Each type of characterization \n used to terrorize prisoners, officers \n of prison and the guards. They wanted to keep me isolated.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Not \n  They said none of this in front of me. But if a guard was coming \n  For service in Ada, they were told in advance \u201cDon't talk to this \n atom. Keep away away. Don't spend time with him. We have instructions from the \n  Above that this man is very dangerous.

The upper ones spread \n These things and gave corresponding commands.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Nevertheless\n None of this was believed by the guards or the \nPrisoners. He was always with me. They always wanted to be taught \nthings from me and spend time with me. Here's why, whichever \nEven if the prison authorities made efforts from above, they did not \nnever materialized. Prisoners and prison staff \nThey understood what kind of person I am. They loved talking to me.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">There was a great distance between what the authorities wanted to do to me and what really happened.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">But because prison is a structure of 19<sup>Th</sup>century, which the British had made, there was no accessibility or \n  Comfort or elementary provisions to live as a human being. \n Everyone had to live in inhumane conditions. And I had to live with \n Too many restrictions - less and by inhumane - because the \n My wheelchair was not moving, they had to carry me in the \n Toilet, get me with their hands.</span></p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Felt\n that my dignity was being violated. They attacked the human condition \nmy. It was a contempt for the very human condition the way that \nThey created these conditions and forced me to live.
