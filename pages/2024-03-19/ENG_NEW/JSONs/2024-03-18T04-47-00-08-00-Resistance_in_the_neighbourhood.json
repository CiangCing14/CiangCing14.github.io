There has been an incident of assault on a minor with a knife\n in Heraklion Square last May, after an antifascist march\n in N. Heraklion. A similar case with a knife attack occurred and \nafter another antifascist mobilization in Kallithea last year in \nFebruary. Also, let's not forget the murderous attack on Shiraz Saftar \nin Perissos in August 2023, which most likely \nHe was covered up so as not to appear to be racially motivated.</div><div><br/></div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-18T04-47-00-08-00/000002.png\" width=\"400\"/></div><br/></div><div>Are all these natural results? \nWhen from the lips of the official political scene and its policies \n\"Serious right\" are heard statements that wink at fascism \nand suggest that young people look for enemies who \"alter the \nculture and values of the nation\" and responsible for the \nimpoverishment and impoverishment of the popular strata, but supposedly \nThey officially condemn fascism. When on social media \nModels of masculinity, cruelty, misogyny, racism are projected\n and more generally hatred towards anything different.</div><div><br/></div><div>The\n Young people carry anger at the system. As long as the popular struggle and\n The movement does not give real answers to the young generation in the face of \nattacking the system, children and young people will become more susceptible \nto such attitudes and ideologies, because of their need to belong\n somewhere. With the logic of \"us against them\", they are attracted to the \nfascism that offers them just all this on a plate.</div><div><br/></div><div>The\n Fascism in the form of the far right is no coincidence that it appears \nmore and more worldwide, and especially in our country. It is the \nLong arm of capital and the bourgeoisie, presented as \nantisystemic force, aiming to strike at the struggling people and the \nminorities and repress them in the name of the system in which \nsupposedly opposed. Fascism is an extension of it \ncapitalist system when it is struggling.</div><div><br/></div><div>It is\n It is important to create strong networks of struggle based on resistance \nthe politics of the system that nourishes fascism but also the \nsolidarity and unity, opposing fascism and \nracist ideas. For this reason, youth and parents must \npoliticize, recognize and fight fascism, \nconfront and respond to such attitudes and ideologies \nin any place, educational or not.<br/><div><div><br/></div><div>FASCISM CRUSHES POPULAR STRUGGLES</div><div></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">RESISTANCE IN THE NORTH</span></b></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://antistasistavoreia.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hattapus://antisatsisatvorey.blogspot.com/</a><br/></div></div></div></div><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div>", "description": "", "author": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2!"], "labels": ["(\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9)\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2", "\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u0392\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1", "\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_77.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
