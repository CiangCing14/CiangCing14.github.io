It was the first social essay of the revolutionary proletariat to take political power, unleashing a civil war against exploiters, establishing an embryonic form of direct working democracy. Not only was it a significant revolutionary action in itself, but also provided a practical model for the future of the proletarian struggle.</p></div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img alt=\"El legado revolucionario de La Comuna de Par\u00eds 1\" class=\"wp-image-21368 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"940\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-19T07-38-35-08-00/000000.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-19T07-38-35-08-00/000000.jpg\" width=\"940\"/></figure></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img alt=\"El legado revolucionario de La Comuna de Par\u00eds 2\" class=\"wp-image-21361 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"530\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"../Images/2024-03-19T07-38-35-08-00/000001.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-03-19T07-38-35-08-00/000001.jpg\" width=\"720\"/></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\"><p>This government emerged spontaneously during the Franco-Prussian war, as a response to general discontent against the bourgeoisie, which had triggered war and exercised a mediocre defense of the homeland.

Its power comes from the direct initiative of the masses from below, replacing repressive institutions with the general weapons of the people and replacing bureaucracy with eligible and removable officials. It serves the proletariat as a ruling class to exercise its dictatorship about the ancient oppressors and exploiters, but at the same time, it is the beginning of the denial of every state.</p></div></div><p></p><div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\"><p>The women, since the beginning of the revolution on March 18, were fundamental in the defense of the city, facing government troops and demonstrating their firmness not only in support work, but with weapons in the barricades; especially during the last week.
