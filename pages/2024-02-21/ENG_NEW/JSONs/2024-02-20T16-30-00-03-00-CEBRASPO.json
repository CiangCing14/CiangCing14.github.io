As usual, houses were invaded without a court term</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Citizens do not have to accept in good man to live under this hell. Nothing justifies exposing workers, children and the elderly to this risk of death. Much less supposed to recover thefts, well materials from large insurance companies.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">It is not just Claudio Castro to blame for these slaughter. And also the federal government that continues to pass on funds to the state without demanding counterparts of respect for people's rights.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The state thinks that terrorizing the population, killing those who protest will repress the popular revolt. All democrats in this country need to give a vigorous repudiation of this genocidal policy against the poor population, the black and brown majority of our state.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><br/></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><br/><br/></span></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"320\" src=\"../Images/2024-02-20T16-30-00-03-00/000000.jpg\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-02-20T16-30-00-03-00/000000.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></div><p></p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div>", "description": "Brazilian Center for Solidarity to Peoples is a democratic entity that aims to defend the right of the people to fight for their rights.", "author": ["CEBRASPO"], "source": "https://cebraspo.blogspot.com/2024/02/mata-com-tiro-de-fuzil-queima-roupa.html"}
