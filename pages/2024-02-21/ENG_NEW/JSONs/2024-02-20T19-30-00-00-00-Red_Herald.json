Panelists from different organizations explained the political situation from their viewpoints , focusing especially on the presidential candidates\u2019 unanimous orientation towards the USA, especially in regards to the question of NATO, and to the candidates\u2019 support to Israel and its so-called \u201cright to defend itself\u201d. Despite some differences in the panelists\u2019 understanding, all agreed that this reflects the State becoming more reactionary.</p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9091\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"648\" sizes=\"(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px\" src=\"../Images/2024-02-20T19-30-00-00-00/000002.png\" srcset=\"../Images/2024-02-20T19-30-00-00-00/000002.png\" width=\"988\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The panel discussion was lively, with many questions made by the audience.

Different critiques of the president were heard, with the Maoist representative focused on the critique of the presidential institution itself. All panelists encouraged the masses to take other action than to vote, expressing their support for a socialist revolution, with the Maoist representative upholding the necessity of armed revolution to crush the bourgeois State apparatus in order to realize this revolution.</p><p>The panelists also made comments in good spirits to each other\u2019s positions, revealing similarities as well as deep differences in lines. The audience was excited and active, making many questions. The last question from the audience was: \u201cWhat gives you hope?\u201d, with all panelists raising up the perspective of the struggle of the masses, and the Maoist representative highlighting the People\u2019s Wars as well as the perspectives of the development of the international communist movement.</p></div>", "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/02/20/finland-anti-election-panel-against-the-presidential-elections-in-tampere/", "type": "article", "title": "Finland: Anti-election panel against the presidential elections in Tampere \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "As we have reported before, recently the presidential election was held in Finland.
