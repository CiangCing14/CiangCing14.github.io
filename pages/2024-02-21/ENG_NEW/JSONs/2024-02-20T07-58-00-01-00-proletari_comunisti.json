There are more than 30 companies of \n subcontracting in the same construction site that means undersular, absence \n of training, building taken as metalworkers because the masters \n So they save costs. And this occurs in all contracts, \n also in factories with \"multiservices\" contracts, with \n false cooperatives that only serve to divide workers for better \n exploit them within the system created by the masters, by \n Stellantis, at the former Ilva, at Marcegaglia, at the warehouses of the \n logistics, in the railways, on construction sites.</span></span></p><p style=\"line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span>There \n Client company of the Site Assassino di Firenze is of the former \n Minister Alfano and is the same as the accident in Genoa in 2023 in \n A construction site always for a Esselunga supermarket in San Benigno where 3 \n workers were injured.</span></span></p><p style=\"line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span>There \n they are precise responsibilities and that is why we call the masters \n Assassins!</span></span></p><p style=\"line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span>AND \n How to call this government of the owners - the Meloni government - that \n More than the other governments of the masters is deployed exclusively on \n their interests, their profits?</span></span></p><p style=\"line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span>The \n Meloni government with the reform of the Salvini procurement code - \n which provides for the \"cascade subcontracting\" - has given the green light to the \n subcontracting, to the custody of the works even without a tender, eliminating \n the constraints of the companies that to make more useful cut the costs of the \n safety, contracts, workers' rights; cuts that \n Especially in construction sites mean accidents, dead.</span></span></p><p style=\"line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span>So \n What is the \"Minister of Business Consultants\" about when \n with \"deep condolence\" announces further interventions of the \n government?</span></span></p><p style=\"line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span>Not \n It is perhaps to encourage black work when she, the minister of \n masters of this government, Marina Calderone, intends to insert the \n amnesty on social security contributions evaded by companies in \n Package that wants to bring to the Council of Ministers?

The minister says nothing and nothing \n It does to increase inspectors and controls!
