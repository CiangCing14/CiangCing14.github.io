An area \n Where I think there is a bit of similarity is that it also has attributes of a \n war of relative industrial capacity and the ability to permanent \n Societies until you get the advances that Eliot spoke and continuous innovation.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><o:p><span></span></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><span>So the big surprises are \n simple. There are really two.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><span>One, how bad the army has done \n Russian, especially at the beginning of<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><span>stages but even the last year, of \n This position war, Eliot spoke.

He<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"></span>another side of the situation is the good that \n The Ukrainians have done. Not only in defending its territory from the \n beginning, but then recovering it. And J\u00e1rkov and Kherson, as Eliot mentioned, and \n Some of the innovations. You know, for a military without army, sinking \n Much of the Black Sea fleet, taking part in the fight in \n Russian territory also last week. Disadruido, you already know, seven airplanes \n Russians That has gone very well. I wish there would be bigger surprises. There are two in \n particular I have in mind. First, if I could go back the clock that \n The United States did not chase. an incremental strategy. I think the Ukrainians \n They would be much better if we had been bolder from the beginning.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><o:p><span></span></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><span>Dr. Jones<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><o:p><span></span></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><span><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"></span>With what?

How would you value the American spare, \n including debates in Congress? And in fact, before your answer, only \n I want to mention something that the United States has provided so far. \n Then we can go to the maps. Around 2 million bullets of 155 \n millimeters, 2,000- In addition to Stingers, Javelins and around 31 tanks \n Abrams. All these are DOD numbers.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>You see \n Bradley, Obuses, Himars, a Patriot, Nasam, of Nasam, \n stroke. Thus we have an idea of what the United States has provided since \n that the invasion began. But what has been the American response more \n recently?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Sra.\nHarding:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Yes, I know it \n It assumes that this graph should relieve my frustration, it is only a work species. \n (Laughs.) I would call him hesitation. The United States response has been hesitant. \n I think, without charity, you could say that we have been to play while Rome \n burn. We have been debating among us, exactly what a little \n Weapons system will take us to the top or not now for two years. And I think Mike \n You are right. If we had not been hesitating early onwards, if \n we would really have provided the things we should have \n provided, I would have been much better now.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>I \n would classify the debate within the United States as partially \n Self -devastation.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>There is a cube \n of that. And then partially self -centered. And the autodisuasion piece is this \n constant convincing ourselves that if we provide the next system \n or additional capacity, so that will be what leans to Russia to expand \n the conflict. It simply has not happened. Russia as interested as us \n in maintaining this restricted to Ukraine. And the more that we allow them to follow \n advancing without retreating, the most will press. Russia is a thug. They respond \n by force.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>The piece \n Egocentric is this completely counterproductive debate, in which there are people \n That says, well, why are we sending all these resources to Ukraine? By \n What do we spend all this money in Ukraine, when we really should leave it \n Here for a fight in the Pacific? Or we should really be keeping it \n here for internal priorities. Is \n Simply the wrong way of seeing it.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>In first \n place, from a basic numerical perspective, I think Angus King of Maine has \n A very good speech about this, the money we spend in Ukraine does not come out of \n USA but goes to the American defense industry. It goes to the US \n They send help to Ukraine. The vast majority stay here.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>The other \n part is that this is not or that. We have done a great job here. in it \n Csis, I know that some of our colleagues in Washington have also done so, that \n The types of weapons you need in a fight in the Pacific are very different \n that the weapons that are needed in a fight in Ukraine. In addition, we have just seen \n Japan takes a step forward and agrees to provide Ukraine all kinds of help. AND \n As they pointed out in the press this morning, they share a common neighbor. So much Japan \n and Ukraine borders Russia. And Japan understands that this is not a Europe or a fight in the Pacific. This is a \n Global message for a thug superpower.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>And that's where \n We also have to think about it.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Cohen:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Can \n participate in this? This is a really interesting table. So you know, order \n Of magnitude, something like 10,000 javelins, that makes sense. That is the missile \n anti -tank you need. The Abrams tank number. However, or with \n Patriot batteries, that's ridiculous. I mean, and the problem is that we \n We tell ourselves, oh, well, we have given you, you know, aerial defenses \n high -end, the Patriots. But a battery? Thirty -one tanks? By \n True, we have hundreds of stored Abrams tanks. These are the model \n Old Abrams. They are not the ones who use our soldiers. They're available. Could \n having gone there a long time ago. And I think it is reflected as a failure in what \n Think: We have not managed to think with the proper urgency level. I am from \n according to Mike and Emily in that. But we have not managed to think about the scale \n correct.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Honorable.\nVickers: Escala.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Cohen:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>And in part, \n It has been a long time, actually from Korea, maybe. some parts of \n Vietnam, but we have really involved in what is a war in which \n There - wear occurs all the time. You know, I think we sometimes do \n A false dichotomy - and I fear that even some of our thinkers \n Military address it in this way: between maneuvers and wear. The wear is not \n It is so much a strategy; It is a war condition. You know, I think of -<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>And nobody wants to be in a war of \n wear.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Cohen:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>But every - \n But if you are in a real war - if you are in a real war, you are in a \n wear war. You know, I think of, say, 1967, the war of the six \n Days, you know. The Israelis lost approximately a quarter of their \n Air Force. And it is important - or if you look, say, you know, to the \n Germans crossing France in 1940, they lost as a fifth of \n His tanks, and you know, even higher percentages, I think. Think in your strength \n Aerial Simply - if you are in a serious war against a war with serious opponent \n - And by the way, it would also happen to us - you're going to take<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>big \n Losses, and that means that you have to think about the right scale. And unfortunately, \n I think that for our part there has been a systematic failure of thinking about the \n Correct scale, with some exceptions such as the 155 millimeters rounds, \n where we are finally expanding production, something that you already know a lot \n about.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Then yes. Yeah.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Sra.\nHarding:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>I can touch \n That also with two fingers? So because I can listen to the screams \n from interwebs, patriot batteries, I really understand that due \n to the shortage of production in that system and because I know many of our \n partners in the Middle East need them desperately to do things like \n Fight against the hutis, who are shooting against Saudi Arabia. This is one \n Reason, not an excuse. And this is where speech is inserted on the basis \n Defense industrial and how we have not been pointing enough to \n Personnel who manufacture things like patriot batteries, there will be a demand for them \n will continue in the next two years, five years, 10 years, so the \n production to meet demand; And even if we say for a second, that \n Tomorrow peace explodes worldwide, we will continue to comply with those contracts, \n So please construct them.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Honorable.\nVickers:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Yes. And I would add, you know, as my say \n Old Chief Bob Gates, you know, you have to win the war you are.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Sra.\nHarding:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Yeah.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>My old \n Chief Mike Vickers also said that. (Laugh.) I want to return to a point, Emily, \n what you did - you raised the perspective of other countries, including some of \n Our adversaries. I think people can forget or not realize that \n When it comes to the Russians, you know, the Russians have also spent \n Significant amounts of ammunition in this war too. So, the \n Ask, in part - and that goes through drones and - where do they get help \n the Russians? And for those who want to focus or think we can \n focus (the United States can only focus on one theater at the same time, so \n that we should really focus on Taiwan, or even only Israel, or - and what \n We cannot do that, the reality when you look cooperation is that the Chinese \n They have provided significant help to the Russians. And it has been in all \n Areas, not in wholesale weapons systems. But a range of technology for \n Russian weapons systems that include everything from microchips for systems \n Weapons to pieces for ammunition.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>The \n North Koreans have provided rockets and ammunition to the Russians. The Iranians have \n provided the Shahed-136 and other drones. Then we are seeing the Russians receiving a variety of help \n of the Chinese, of the North Koreans and the Iranians, which makes states \n United retains your help at this time is surprising because we have not seen \n The Chinese in that sense, stop providing assistance to the Russians.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Also \n I wanted to understand your opinion, Emily, about Europeans and where are the \n Europeans when providing help to Ukraine. There are also - it has also been \n Talking that Germans would provide taurus, for example, that it is a \n greater scope ammunition. what is your sense of where the Europeans are and \n How useful have they been when providing help to Ukraine? And then \n You know, if you can add something else.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>We have \n Listened to many criticisms. About Europeans by several politicians \n Regarding its defense expenditure, including 2 percent of the gross domestic product.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>So, \n Yeah. Yes. Mrs. Harding: mmm hmm. So, to complement your excellent \n argument about China, we should not forget how much China has \n Bought Russian cheap fuel, which is to keep the Russian economy afloat and allow them \n do all the things they are doing. More than saying about that.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>But when \n These are Europeans, you know, I spent the first year of this war \n reassuring European allies that the United States is in this to \n The long term, which Biden has said that we are in this long term.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>The Russians \n They are an old enemy. We understand that this will be important not only for \n Ukraine security but also for the security of Europe. Yes, there is talk of \n Extremes about people, you know, they talk about their support to Ukraine. But \n Those are the ends of the bell curve. They were in this long term. AND \n Then, after a year passed, some of those bell -curved voices to the \n end they obtained a little stronger and a little more central and then I found myself \n Saying is going well. It's going to be OK. People like to add points \n politicians. But they will recover.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Now me \n I find in the situation of having to look at Europeans in the face and say: really \n I don't know what will happen to the current help package. I still have hope \n that the chamber enters into reason and approves it because it is of vital importance \n for security in many ways.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Could be \n Well for Ukraine and also for the United States at the same time.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>But I think \n that Europeans are really beginning to ask difficult questions about \n They themselves: how does European security look like the presence of states \n Joined? as?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>The \n unfortunate comments from former president Trump the other day about<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>I think that \n Nan really shook them in a way that is difficult to ignore and are starting \n to look at things from defense production to the end and through, already \n You know, communications with each other.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>We are \n Seeing a silent defense production in some places and a defense \n louder. production in others. They are far from being able to do it, right? already \n They know, direct NATO without the United States, but some are being raised \n Very difficult questions.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>And finally \n I want to point out that some of our colleagues here in the CSIS have made a \n really good work in NATO and we are working on a project now \n on whether the 2 percent threshold is really relevant, if there are other ways to measure what they should be \n Really the contributions of NATO and if the 2 percent question is \n Just a false track.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Yeah, \n Frankly, I think it is mainly a false track. I think the subject, to \n end of the day - and I have also written about this - it is to what extent and how they are \n Useful Europeans and high -level war, for example. So that \n leads to aerial capabilities, land capacities, naval capacities, including \n The anti -submarine war. That takes you out of the percentage problem. And much more to \n The capacities to perform operations.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Cohen:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Let me not agree with that. Believe \n That, on the one hand, it is important power to measure in a way, you know, more \n Reasonable and militarily relevant operational contributions.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>A figure \n of 2 percent of GDP, which is too low; I mean, I would say it's shooting \n at 3 (percent) or -<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>state \n United is closer to ... is in the range of 3 percent, right?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Cohen:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Is politically significant and is a message \n for the public involved and for the governments involved that we hope \n put important resources against their own defense and not put excuses and say, \n Well, we are hosts your forces, that is also a contribution.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>I don't know \n I can ... I don't think we can ignore its psychological dimension. I wanted to add, \n If I am allowed, two more things. One is American production. is \n Absolutely fundamental because we have the largest military industry and despite my previous scathing criticisms, \n We can expand things and get them on top. But it is also fundamental \n because we provide leadership and the type of central focus for this. These \n There are two - there are two types of industrial coalition competitors here. You \n One mentioned, Russia - Iran, China in the background with components and things, \n North Korea.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>With us \n They are the Europeans, obviously, with the United States. But, you know, the Koreans \n Del Sur play a role and the Japanese play a role and states \n United is critical for that. So, if ... you know, and the South Koreans \n They sell 155 (- millimeters) so that we can then give ours \n Ukrainians; Indeed part of the game. We have to be in the center of \n that.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Now, I think \n That is important because ... I mean, I think the four are we tend to \n be quite critical, and properly, with our own government. In \n reality, Russians are found differently in a world of pain.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>They are ... already \n You know, they are in a state of mobilization. It is not clear that<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>really \n They have been able to increase military production in a tremendously way \n significant. They still fight with the production of advanced parts. of team \n military. You know, for example, they have had this T-14 armata. tank they have \n State speaking for years. It is supposed to be incredible. system. Have had \n Problems to implement it. They have had trouble getting it to occur. \n Its fossil fuel income has been decreasing. Yes, the Chinese \n They buy that oil. The Chinese are good merchants. And then they understand \n that. Oil is cheap and they ... you know, they don't have the same pipelines \n and those things. how that.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>So I think \n That, you know, the Russians - the very fact that they have to depend on the \n North Koreans by 152 millimeter projectiles, which have as a caliber 30 percentage \n Failure, he tells you something about his military industry. So you know, \n We should remind ourselves that if we, if the United States \n It is in the center, we propose it and keep the feet of our allies \n Europeans on fire, we can easily overcome these types both in quantity \n As in quality, safe, but I would say that even in quantitative terms. \n But there has to be a lot of political energy put in it. AND \n Unfortunately I don't see that.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>So, returning to its European point, yes, it is \n important to spend more on the Ministry of Defense. That 2 percent threshold \n In a certain sense, it simply highlights that. But at the end of the day, I think \n It is also important how they are spending their money. So, if we can achieve \n this. I'm going to go with Mike in a second with a question. But if we could show \n The image here. I just want the \n people see here. This is one of the Iranian drones, the Shahed. 136. This was \n Disabled in kyiv, and is now in possession of Ukrainians. You can also see \n Here it is an Iranian drone. And here this Iranian flag is on the side. \n So this gives us an idea of some of the other countries that have been \n providing assistance to the Russians.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>What me \n Take, Mike, the Russians. That is, its Russian military evaluation. You already spoke a \n Little about this, but what do you have? Well done, in your sense? Where has you fought? \n And are we seeing some? Evolution of the Russian concept of operations? They used \n more air than had in the past in the offensive of Avdiivka. What does it mean \n that?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Honorable.\nVickers:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>So, \n Where the Russians have done the best they can really be in this position of position \n where they have had an artillery advantage and an advantage. AND \n then those two things - and, in addition, the nine months, essentially, they were given \n To dig, prepare, put mined fields and other things that made the \n Ukrainian summer offensive last year was very problematic. That, and the \n lack of aerial power of the Ukrainians. You know, we essentially ask \n Ukrainians to fight a war in a way that the US army \n or the Western military would never do it. And you know, you just can't \n win that way. That is, it is military negligence.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>So there \n It is where they have done better. They have done the worst they have been able to in the field \n Integrated combined weapons operations, airborne operations. AND \n This is something we have seen with the Russian army in the Russian-Georgian war. \n They thought they had plans to fix these things, you know, of the \n learned lessons. They have not really done a good job. And you know, if everything \n There seems to be worsened as the scale has increased. I mean, your \n Great advantage at this time is really in resources. And it may be \n more fragile than people think.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Then yes \n We could open the slide, just to emphasize what Mike noticed. Can<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Look at this \n It is ... this was last year. But we can see some of the Russian fighting of \n positions. The trenches that raised here, the dragon's teeth. These \n They are multiple rows of dragon teeth. You can't see it here because it is \n buried, but the mined fields, the anti -tanks that have used, the \n Mortar site and weapons locations they have had. They had \n time during last year's offensive to strengthen some of these \n defenses measures. What about Russian air?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Honorable.\nVickers:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Yes, the air \n Russian, you know, it has been based mainly on missiles and aerial vehicles \n Bened for strategic attack against populated centers. You know, and \n He certainly had some success in that. In terms of air power in the field of \n Battle, during the Ukrainian offensive they used attack helicopters reasonably \n Good to limit Ukrainian penetrations. Fixed wing airplanes have not \n done a lot. You know played a role in Avdiivka towards the end, when the \n Ukrainian army was withdrawing under pressure -<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>And I didn't have many Earth-Aire missiles.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Honorable.\nVickers:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>And had no earth-Aire missiles. But mainly \n He stayed behind the lines and plain pumps that can enter and \n achieve objectives. And then it has not been a great player. You know, the \n Russian doctrine integrates air with armies in the field, making the army \n superior. A little different from our approach.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Me too \n I would add that, you know, its operational advantages are<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>One thing. It \n that the Russians really tell to win the war is<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>essentially \n knocking out the allies of Ukraine. Basically cutting international support. \n You know, Eliot talked about this and Emily talked about political problems in the \n Congress. But you know, that's his theory. of the victory, is that if it is cut \n Help, will have a much better opportunity.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Well, \n Because they also receive help. Then the balance of power changes dramatically.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Honorable.\nVickers:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>If they \n They also receive help. The balance of power changes, exactly.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Sra.\nHarding:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>This is one of those self -complicated prophecies of \n those that spoke at the beginning. What is the message that Russians want \n Let's absorb? that Ukraine cannot win, so we should withdraw the support. \n And that idea that this is going to be totally self -fulfilled, which once we accept \n The Russian policy of line then we go back, which makes it true, I think that \n It is what we have to protect at all costs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Honorable.\nVickers:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>I think that \n Lenin called them useful idiots.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Cohen:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Well, and in \n a way is already happening. I mean, even put Tucker aside \n Carlson, you know, you look at Senator Vance of Ohio. I mean, that's ... it's \n saying what Russians would like me to say. that there is no way that \n The Ukrainians can win, so we are realistic and stop helping them.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Dr. Jones:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Well, \n Emily, the Russians have also been active in many other areas. We have seen \n Navalny face death. We have seen a Ukrainian deserter probably \n Killed in Spain. What else do you have? I mean, what are you doing with what they are \n doing the Russians now in various fields?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Sra.\nHarding:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span></span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>I mean, they get paid in a way that \n It seems quite surprising. What is clear: Navalny did not fall dead because \n own will in a Russian prison. I know in my bones as sure as \n I'm sitting here, and I didn't even have to do it. Be on the floor with him. \n We will discover it at some point in the future that was in fact killed, and it was \n Killed at a certain time for a certain reason. The fact that Putin \n It has allowed it just before Munich the conference is quite interesting. \n That came out almost at the same time that some news arose about some \n New Russian capabilities potentially being in space, I think it is very \n interesting.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><o:p><span></span></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span>Transcription will continue ....</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span><o:p><span></span></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span>\u200b<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></p><b><span></span></b><p></p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div>", "description": "We publish two annexes, one is from a US newspaper and, the other, of a Yankee imperialism research center: 1.
