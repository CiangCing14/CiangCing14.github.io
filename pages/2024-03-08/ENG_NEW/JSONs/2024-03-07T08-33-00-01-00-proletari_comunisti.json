A list of despair that stretches after protests for \n The conditions of invivability inside the center for the repatriation of Rome. \n  A prison in all respects with high rallies closed cages \n Over eight meters, reduced hygiene to light, solitude and despair \n of those who are not even understood when he speaks</p><p>On February 27 the first case little by little<a href=\"https://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2024/03/03/news/proteste_ponte_galeria_cpr_anarchici_bomba_carta-422244938/\">Less than a month from suicide</a>Of<strong>Ousmane Sylla</strong>who hanged himself.

In the last few days they are counted in Ponte \n Galeria an average of an attempted suicide a day, practically one \n massacre. Indeed the thrilling hypothesis is that migrants try suicide \n Hoping to return to freedom because it is not suitable for life in community. \n All this happens in the general disinterest but instead it is time to \n tell them these places and demand that they are closed - says the \n parliamentarian Ilaria Cucchi -. Three guests were declared not \n suitable and wonders why they were in there. I will do everything \n what is in my possibilities starting from a question \n parliamentary. And as happened in the city of Ferrara, where \n We paraded in 1,500 associations and civil society, we will continue \n  to do in each city to ask that the CPR be closed. \"<p></p><div id=\"adv-Bottom\"></div><p></p><p>On February 29, three were attempting to end it \n Always binding the sheets to the railings: Salhi Saber, El Maddahi \n Othman, Mohamed Al\u00ec Eltayahi. On February 4th there was one \n protest at the CPR for several hours following the death of Ousmana Sylla, \n The 22 -year -old from Guinea, who was found hanged with a \n Lip to a grate. The young man, before killing himself, left a \n Message that is a testament: he wrote his name, his own on the wall \n surname, his village of origin. And a prayer: \u201cPlease, \n I report my body in Africa, I miss my country a lot, me \n My mother is missing. Law enforcement officers do not understand anything, \n Not even my language. I can't take it anymore, I just want my soul \n rest in peace\". During the disorders two were injured \n military and arrested fourteen migrants.</p><p>On March 4, two were hospitalized at the Aurelia \n Hospital and Sant\u2019Eugenio. This is Barry Abdoulaye and Mohamed \n Elbikri. Just from the latter boy, 23 years old, the count began \n of attempted suicides because the girlfriend had tried to get in \n Contact with the CPR to find out what happened to. \"My boyfriend \n Yesterday he got dressed in Ponte Galeria, was taken to the hospital but not \n We have news. His name is Mohamed Elbikri, he asked to be \n repatriated. In the last two weeks it was always under therapy almost \n Sedato \u201d, the woman had written in a message to the associations.
