Finally, on February 2, a control judge imposed the precautionary measure of justified pre-trial detention on the detainees.</p>\n<p><strong>7th of February.</strong> A district judge in Salina Cruz sentenced David Hern\u00e1ndez Salazar, Community Agent of Puente Madera and member of the APIIDTT organization, to 46 years and 6 months in prison for opposing the dispossession of communal lands.</p>\n<p><strong>13</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of </strong><strong>February.</strong> Elements of municipal and state police with high-powered weapons and without riot gear evicted our artisan and merchant comrades from the Gurri\u00f3n walkway, next to the Temple of Santo Domingo, violating their right to work and the agreements signed with the municipal and state governments.</p>\n<p><strong>18th of February. </strong>Elements of the Navy violently evict and detain retired railroad workers who were demonstrating on the railroad tracks in Mat\u00edas Romero.</p>\n<p><strong>29</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of February.</strong> State police install metal fences in the street of the city\u2019s main square, in anticipation of new demonstrations.
